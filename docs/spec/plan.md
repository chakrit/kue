# Kue Plan

The live implementation roadmap. Kept small, current, and actionable — one focused slice
at a time. The full record of completed slices lives in
[`../reference/implementation-log.md`](../reference/implementation-log.md) (chronological,
one entry per commit) and `git log`; this file holds only where we are and what's next.
A periodic plan-hygiene pass distills it back to the live roadmap (history → log + git);
see [`../guides/slice-loop.md`](../guides/slice-loop.md). Last distilled 2026-06-20.

## North Star

Kue targets **CUE v0.15 semantics, done correctly**. Where the official `cue` v0.16.1
binary is buggy, Kue implements the *correct* behavior, not the bug. The compatibility
target is the language as specified, not bug-for-bug parity. See
[`../decisions/2026-06-14-cue-compatibility-target.md`](../decisions/2026-06-14-cue-compatibility-target.md).

## Working Principles

- TDD where behavior is testable: theorem checks or executable examples before code.
- Keep the semantic model simple before optimizing representation.
- Total functions and explicit semantic values over hidden host-language failure.
- Avoid dependencies until they clearly remove more complexity than they add.
- One slice per commit; subject mirrors the slice title. Small enough to review/revert.
- **Correctness over performance.** A latent unsound result is a Violation even with no
  failing fixture; a perf miss is acceptable. See [`../decisions/`](../decisions/).
- **Spec is the authority; `cue` is a fallible cross-check, never the gate.** Byte-identical
  to `cue` is structurally bug-replicating. Conform to the CUE spec; where it is silent, to
  lattice first principles (precise, total, illegal-states-unrepresentable). When `cue`
  disagrees with the spec it is WRONG → follow the spec, record in `cue-divergences.md`.
- **Real-app compilation is a stress test, not the goal.** Getting prod9 infra (argocd,
  cert-manager) to `export` *validates* correct semantics; it is never an end in itself.
  Rank slices by spec-correctness and clean design evolution — never let one app's shape
  pull the loop into per-app special-casing. A real-app blocker needing app-specific
  narrowing is parked as a stress-test finding (argocd/Bug2-5), not promoted to the
  critical path; it resolves as the general semantics mature.

## Standing Capabilities (what Kue does now)

The semantic core is broad and oracle-checked against `cue` v0.16.1
(`/Users/chakrit/go/bin/cue`). Currently working, cue-exact modulo the tracked
field-ordering byte-parity gap (#3):

- **Evaluator + lattice.** Total `meet`/`join` over the full `Value` domain; primitives,
  kinds, bounds, regex, struct/list shapes. `Field` is a `structure`. Disjunctions with
  default-mark algebra (unification ANDs default sets; arithmetic/comparison/unary
  resolve-operand-first; nested two-level precedence; equal-default dedup). Structural-cycle
  detection: `#L:{n,next:#L}` errors; `#List | *null` terminates on `*null` (D#2).
  ```cue
  port: int & >0 & <=65535
  port: 8080  // 8080
  ```
- **Closures / cross-package def-meet.** `Value.closure (frame) (body)` carries the capture
  frame so an imported def's body unifies with the use-site *before* its cross-frame
  self/sibling refs resolve. Deep/nested self-ref detection (`hasSelfRefAtDepth`); multi-level
  embed chains resolve. Forcing tier closes imported def bodies at capture.
  ```cue
  import "ex.com/pkg"
  web: pkg.#Def & {name: "web"}
  ```
- **Comprehensions.** Struct (`for k,v in s {…}`) and list (`[for x in xs {x}]`, incl. `if`
  guards, `let` clauses (D#3), nested/multi/zero-yield, plain+comp interleave). Guard
  classification (D#1b/c): incomplete guard DEFERS (residual node), concrete non-bool guard
  is a TYPE ERROR, presence-test `X !=/== _|_` drops. Scalar struct-embedding collapse
  (`{5}`→`5`) at embed-eval.
  ```cue
  out: [for x in [1, 2, 3] {x * 2}]  // [2, 4, 6]
  ```
- **Disjunction defaults under embedding.** Use-site narrowing distributes into every arm of
  an embedded default disjunction, pruning dead arms.
  ```cue
  x: (*"a" | "b") & ("b" | "c")  // "b"
  ```
- **Fuel-saturation perf.** Eval count FLAT across fuel (bracketed monotonic truncation
  counter; truncated values fuel-keyed, saturated results fuel-free). `evalFuel = 100`.
  Frame-id sharing + force-memo. Cache keyed on a bounded-depth structural digest
  (`valueDigest`, `DIGEST_DEPTH=3`; `BEq` untouched → soundness unconditional).
- **Builtins.** `base64.Encode`, `json.Marshal` (`Kue/Json.lean`), `yaml.Marshal`
  (`Kue/Yaml.lean`), `regexp.Match`, `math.Pow` (exact non-neg-int-exponent domain),
  `list.Sort`/`SortStable`, `strings.*`/`list.*`/`math.*` namespaces. Multiline strings.
  ```cue
  import "encoding/json"
  out: json.Marshal({a: 1})  // "{\"a\":1}"
  ```
- **Regex.** RE2-equivalent AST → NFA matcher in `Kue/Regex.lean` (a true leaf), incl. `\b`,
  lazy quantifiers, in-class `\D`/`\W`/`\S` set-complement, `maxRepeat=1000`. Corpus
  divergence-free.
- **Imports / modules.** `cue.mod` discovery, in-module + cross-module (vendored or
  extract-cache) resolution by longest module-path prefix, multi-file merge, transitive
  loads, package-dir entry (`kue export ./apps`), qualified import path
  `"location:identifier"` (F-3, `Import.packageName`). IO confined to `Kue/Module.lean`;
  `Eval`/`Resolve` stay pure. (Registry/OCI fetch deferred — prod9 is fully on-disk.)
- **CLI.** `kue eval`, `kue export [--out yaml|json] [file|dir]` (stdin or arg), clean
  missing-file diagnostics + exit codes.

**Real-app status** (prod9 infra, read-only oracle):
- **cert-manager: content-identical drop-in, ~30.6s.** Exports correctly at production fuel,
  byte-identical to `cue` modulo field-order #3 (the item-7 cache-hash digest collapsed the
  ~119s O(N²) wall to ~30.6s).
- **argocd: `packs.#Argo` (link 5) content-correct** (4-link chain). All three components
  content-identical to `cue` (sorted-key, modulo field-order #3) in the scratch module. **Full
  `apps/argocd.cue` STILL bottoms** — the residual is a deterministic CORRECTNESS divergence
  (**Bug2-5**, let-buried two-level embed comprehension-guard narrowing), NOT a fuel ceiling.
  PARKED as a stress-test finding; resolves as the general semantics mature.

## Live Backlog (open work, ranked)

Correctness gates real-app adoption; cleanups are parallel-safe filler. Two backlog owners:
the **spec-conformance fixes** are owned by
[`spec-conformance-audit.md`](spec-conformance-audit.md) § Consolidated fix backlog (the
authoritative ranked list — do NOT duplicate it here); the **plan-only roadmap** below owns
the non-spec-conformance work.

**Spec-conformance fixes (authoritative ranking in `spec-conformance-audit.md`):** the
argocd residual **Bug2-5** (PARKED), **BI-1** (Unicode case-fold — spike data approach
first), **BI-2-residual** (Sqrt + neg/fractional Pow), **SC-3** display-residual, **SC-4**
(spec-gap-first), **SC-1b** (closed×closed-pattern), **A#6** (`containsBottom` fuel cap,
standalone), the 4 spec-gap ratifications, **DRY-1** (let-walker extraction).

### Plan-only roadmap (not in the spec-conformance backlog)

Sequence after the spec-conformance correctness work: bank cheap-ready cleanups, then the
perf frontier (#7 residual), then the deeper parity gap (#6).

**Numbered durable items (cross-reference IDs):**

1. **`truncate-primitive` (HIGH — soundness hardening).** The truncation-bump invariant (a
   `fuel=0` helper that drops fields MUST bump `truncCount`) is held by DISCIPLINE across six
   sites. Step 1 (do now): add an `EvalState.truncate` combinator fusing bump+return; rewrite
   all six sites — strictly behavior-preserving, byte-identical fixtures, localizes the bump.
   Step 2 (only if cheap): a `withFuel` combinator routing the `fuel=0` dispatch so a seventh
   helper physically cannot skip the bump — attempt only for the four top-level-`fuel`-dispatch
   helpers; STOP at step 1 + a one-line doc invariant if step 2 exceeds mechanical. HIGH: this
   is the illegal-states-unrepresentable reason-to-be; the audit-#6 corruption it prevents
   already shipped once latent.

2. **EvalOps extraction → `Kue/EvalOps.lean` (ACTIONABLE, PARALLEL-SAFE).** ~256 lines of
   self-contained pure scalar algebra (`evalAdd…evalBinary` + `distributeUnary`/
   `distributeBinary`, `Eval.lean:782/1042/1088/1093`) carved out from under the recursive
   evaluator, no back-edge into `evalValueWithFuel`. CORRECTION: it also calls
   `divValue`/`modValue`/`quoValue`/`remValue` from `Builtin.lean` — so `EvalOps` imports
   `{Value, Decimal, Builtin}`, OR move those four pure decimal ops into `EvalOps`/`Decimal`
   first (cleaner). Resolve the import shape in the slice. Mechanical otherwise. (Confirmed
   still inline + live by Phase-B 2026-06-20.)

3. **Test/fixture-org pass (periodic — DUE 2026-06-20).** `EvalTests.lean` has re-grown to
   ~1505 lines (the D#1b/c + D#3 batch added ~300 lines of `classify_guard_*` + `letcomp_*`
   pins on top of the ~1210 post-split size); the natural re-split carves a
   `ComprehensionTests`/`GuardTests` module for the comprehension-clause + guard-classification
   pins. Other large modules unchanged: `FixturePorts` (~2979, generated — leave whole),
   `TwoPassTests` (~1030), `FixtureTests` (~992), `BuiltinTests` (~884), `ClosureTests` (~755),
   `StructTests`/`ParseTests`/`LatticeTests` (~605-618). Ride-along: sub-group the two large
   fixture dirs `testdata/cue/{definitions (100), comprehensions (54)}` into
   `comprehensions/{list,struct,let,guard}/`. LOWER priority than the MED-tail feature slices;
   run within 1-2 audit cycles, before `EvalTests` crosses ~1800.

4. **Field-ordering parity #3 (MEDIUM, DEEP — byte-parity vs `cue`).** `cue` orders `ref &
   {own}` own-fields-first; Kue is left-struct-first (`mergeStructFieldsWith`, `Lattice.lean`).
   `cue`'s rule tracks where each label is *first introduced* across conjuncts in eval order —
   faithful replication needs a per-`Field` introduction-provenance key threaded through every
   merge/manifest site, not a one-line fold flip. The byte-order tail between cert-manager
   content-match and byte-exact; affects the dominant `#Def & {…}` prod9 pattern's export order.
   Multi-slice + a provenance-key design spike first. (Now reclassified as a deliberate spec gap
   #3 — Kue's stable source order is the more principled choice; pursue only if it blocks a
   needed fixture.)
   ```cue
   #Def: {kind: "X", ...}
   out: #Def & {own: 1}  // cue: own-fields ordered first
   ```

5. **Per-eval-cost perf (frontier — hash digest DONE; residual open).** The cache-key hash
   digest landed (cert-manager 119s → ~30.6s, byte-identical modulo #3, zero drift; FrameKey
   follow-up profiled as NOT needed). **Residual (the live perf frontier):** the heavy `argo`
   sub-package times out >200s once past the early bottom. Gated on the argocd unblock (its
   bottom is the Bug2-5 CORRECTNESS divergence, not fuel) — profile against a resolving target.

6. **Borderline / LOW (opportunistic; none block adoption).**
   - **`scalar-embed-with-decls`** — `{#a:1, 5}`→`5` (`cue` manifests `5`, keeps `.#a`
     selectable); Kue bottoms. Incompleteness, not unsound. Needs a scalar-with-decls carrier
     (the `.embeddedList` analog for scalars). Do NOT "fix" by widening the scalar collapse —
     that is the unsound direction.
   - **`module-file-scoped-imports`** (arch-sized) — Kue merges every sibling file's import
     bindings into one shared package frame; CUE scopes them per-file. Bites only the
     same-NAME-different-target case; real prod9 doesn't hit it. Bind each file's imports into a
     per-file scope frame.
   - **`import-eager-closedness`** (MEDIUM) — an imported plain closed `.struct` def met with
     extra fields admits them on the EAGER selector path (the force path closes correctly).
     Close imported def bodies at load, or route the eager path through
     `normalizeDefinitionValueWithFuel`. Pin both silent-admit and incomplete-mask facets.
   - **Parser strictness** — `*(1|2)` laxity (`cue` rejects at parse); `__x`
     double-underscore accepted (`cue` reserves `__`-prefixed idents). Track under a
     parser-strictness pass.
   - **DRY `selectEvaluatedField .disj`** — the resolved-default arm re-lists the 5-arm
     struct-shape dispatch; collapse to `match resolveDisjDefault? alternatives` (gains free
     nested-disjunction recursion).
   - **B3 (`comprehensionPairs` `.embeddedList`)** — `for x in {#a:1,[1,2]}` iterates ZERO
     times where CUE iterates `[1,2]`; add an `.embeddedList items _ _ => some (listPairsFrom 0
     items)` arm. Incompleteness, not unsound; ride-along with `scalar-embed-with-decls`.
   - **B2-A1 (latent, currently lossless)** — `applyEvaluatedStructN` (`Eval.lean:330`) routes
     the patterns-present case through a meet that DROPS `tail`. Lossless today (the only tail a
     parsed struct carries is bare `...` = `.top`, a no-op to drop+re-supply); breaks the day
     typed-ellipsis lands. Thread `tail` through the pattern arm + a round-trip pin; pairs with
     any typed-ellipsis slice.
   - **B2-A2 (test-gap fill)** — both B2.5 fixtures exercise patterns-LEFT × tail-RIGHT; the
     reverse and both-tails+patterns are pinned only by `native_decide`. Add
     `testdata/cue/definitions/{tail_pattern_unify,both_tails_pattern_unify}` pairs +
     `FixturePorts` entries (oracle: `{a:5,...} & {[string]:int}` → `{a:5}` open).
   - **A2-x (latent) — `importBinding` merge-asymmetry.** `mergeFieldClass` returns `none` for
     `importBinding & <real field>` (merges only with itself) where the old `.hidden` merged via
     `.field`. Unobservable today (the only collision `cue` rejects at LOAD — see A2-y).
   - **A2-y (pre-existing) — missing import-name redeclaration check.** A top-level field
     colliding with an imported package's local name (`import ".../dep"` + `dep: {…}`) is a LOAD
     error in `cue`; Kue silently keeps both. File as a small loader slice. (Both A2-x/A2-y are
     corners prod9 doesn't hit.)
   - **`scalar-embed` provenance follow-ups** — opportunistic pins (3-level flatten, disj ops
     beyond `+`/`&`, composed select-into-F1-default) when next touching Lattice/Eval.
   - **`resolveEmbeddedDisjDefault` (`Eval.lean:2093`)** — verify the pass-1 label-surfacing
     path does NOT also need the use-site-narrowing distribution that `embed-disj-arm-fallthrough`
     added, or that label-surfacing-only is correct there.

**Walker / normalizer dedup family (post-argocd, LOW/MED-risk + LOW-urgency, gated behind
correctness — never promoted ahead of a spec-conformance fix):**

Phase-B 2026-06-20 ruling (do not re-litigate): these are NOT one problem. There are THREE
distinct walker families plus a separate normalizer pair — four different mechanisms, result
types, recursion domains, and termination measures. Folding all under one abstraction would
be a false "stuff they all do" extraction. **Sequencing: AD4-1 first → A-EN3+DRY-1 locality
batch → AD2-1.**

- **AD4-1 (MEDIUM — comprehension-walker dedup; FIRST in the sequence).** The four `expand*`
  comprehension clause-walkers (`expandClausesWithFuel`/`expandForPairsWithFuel` →
  `ClauseExpansion`; `expandListClausesWithFuel`/`expandListForPairsWithFuel` →
  `ListClauseExpansion`, `Eval.lean:3310–3462`) are `EvalM`-effectful clause-chain drivers
  whose `.guard`/`.letClause`/`.forIn` arms are BYTE-IDENTICAL (verified line-by-line), as are
  the bottom/deferred short-circuit folds. `ClauseExpansion`/`ListClauseExpansion` are
  STRUCTURALLY IDENTICAL 3-ctor sums (`fields`/`items` ⊕ `bottom Value` ⊕ `deferred`) → one
  generic `ClauseOutcome β` (β = `List Field` / `List Value`); the two named sums collapse to β
  instantiations, the four public defs become thin β-instantiating wrappers. Combinator: one
  `expandClauseChain` + one `expandForPairs`, both generic in β, parameterized by the whole
  `[]`-arm body-handler.
  **VERIFIED-CORRECT asymmetry the refactor MUST preserve+pin (orchestrator probe 2026-06-20):**
  the struct `[]` arm short-circuits a `.bottom`/`.bottomWith` body (D#1a); the LIST `[]` arm
  does NOT (`expandListClausesWithFuel:3408-3409` wraps ANY `evaluatedBody`, incl. a bottom, as a
  one-element list). `out: [for x in [1] {x & "s"}]` → Kue `out: [_|_]` (1-element list, bottom
  element); `cue eval` renders the SAME value as `out.0: conflicting values`. So `[_|_]` ≠ `_|_`
  is CORRECT CUE list semantics — a bottom element does NOT collapse the list. The body→outcome
  callback is where this divergence lives, so the combinator MUST take the whole `[]`-arm
  body-handler as a parameter (a naive "wrap the body" callback would wrongly make the list twin
  bottom-propagate). PIN both eval forms + the export-errors; do NOT reconcile the twins on this
  point. (Whether the list-arm non-propagation is itself a latent bug is a SEPARATE correctness
  question — file/verify independently of the dedup.) Gate: byte-identical fixtures +
  `termination_by` preserved + axiom-clean. Most self-contained of the three (one mutual block,
  no cross-module reach, no agreement-theorem surface).
- **A-EN3 (LOW — pure structural `Value` folds; bundle with DRY-1 by edit-LOCALITY).**
  `defFrameRefIndices`/`selfReferencedLabels`/`refsSelfEmbeddedLabel` (`Eval.lean:303/209/101`)
  are three structural folds over the FULL `Value` ctor tree, `+1`-at-each-frame-pusher depth,
  `descendClauses` for the comprehension arms; differ ONLY in leaf (`.refId`/`.selector`) +
  monoid (`List Nat`/`List String`/`Bool`). Abstraction: `foldValueWithDepth` parameterized on
  monoid + leaf (the shape B7 used). `closeDefFrameReadIndices` REUSES `defFrameRefIndices`,
  `embedDisjArmDeclLabels` is a shallow one-hop ref-follow — so A-EN3 is exactly those three.
  Gate: B7-style agreement theorems + totality preserved. (DRY-1 is the sibling — see audit doc;
  both CALL `defFrameRefIndices`, so do them together to avoid touching that callee + its
  theorems twice. They produce TWO combinators, not one.)
- **AD2-1 (LOW-MEDIUM — disjunction-normalizer dedup; FILE as a slice, do NOT apply inline).**
  `normalizeEvaluatedDisj` (`Eval.lean:694`, EVAL path) and `normalizeDisj` (`Lattice.lean:277`,
  LATTICE/meet path) are near-identical over the same domain, differing ONLY on the LONE-arm
  rule: `normalizeDisj` collapses only `[(.regular, v)]` (a lone DEFAULT arm stays `.disj
  [(.default, v)]`, surfacing as `*1`), `normalizeEvaluatedDisj` collapses `[(_, v)]`
  mark-agnostically (→ `1`). Both VALUE-sound. **Paths are DISJOINT (different layers, different
  post-conditions — eval keeps the marked disjunction for display); the shared core is just the
  `liveAlternatives` lone-arm rule.** The lone-DEFAULT case `a: (*1|2)&(>=1 & <2)` flows through
  `normalizeDisj` (the lattice `.disj & value` arm): `cue`'s value is `1`, Kue displays `*1` —
  the eval-display divergence, on the lattice path. **File-not-inline because option (a) flips
  TWO NAMED theorem pins** (`meet_disjunction_preserves_default_marker:Tests.lean:75` +
  `lattice_meet_disjunction_preserves_default_marker:LatticeTests.lean:152`, both asserting lone
  -default-marker preservation) + the SC-3 display contract — exceeds the inline byte-identical
  bar; the named-pin rename is a contract change a human should sign off. Zero `.expected`
  fixtures flip (swept all 7 `*`-carrying — every one is MULTI-arm, which the lone-arm rule never
  touches; multi-arm soundness `b: a & 2 = 2` is INDEPENDENT). **The slice:** (a) make
  `normalizeDisj`'s lone-arm collapse mark-agnostic (`[(_, v)] => v`); (b) update + rename the two
  pins to `= .prim (.int 1)` (the marker is NOT preserved on a lone arm — the name now lies); (c)
  have `normalizeEvaluatedDisj`'s has-default branch DELEGATE to `normalizeDisj` for the
  `[]`/lone/multi shape (the all-regular `joinValues` branch stays in `normalizeEvaluatedDisj`);
  (d) amend `cue-spec-gaps.md` row-6 to scope its "keep marked" basis to MULTI-arm only. Couples
  with SC-3; sequence with any disjunction-DISPLAY slice, NOT with the walkers (it is a
  lattice/eval layer-boundary dedup, not a frame/clause walker).

**Resolved / ruled-out (recorded so they are not re-raised):**

- **AD3-1 / item-3 Regex extraction / B5 regex bullet — DROPPED (stale).** `Kue/Regex.lean`
  already exists as a verified TRUE LEAF (no top-level `import`; `Value.lean:1` is `import
  Kue.Regex`, so the engine is OUT of `Value.lean`). The RX-1a/b NFA rebuild superseded the
  "extract the backtracking engine" framing. Nothing to do.
- **AD3-4 (bottom-payload newtype) — RULED OUT (over-engineering).** `GuardVerdict.bottom`,
  `ClauseExpansion.bottom`, `ListClauseExpansion.bottom` carry an unconstrained `Value` where
  only a bottom is valid, but the invariant is already enforced BY CONSTRUCTION (every
  construction site is one of two arms that can physically only pass a bottom — `classifyGuard`,
  the two clause-expansion arms). A `BottomValue` newtype would ripple through every
  `.bottom`/`.bottomWith` match site (the whole `Value` domain deliberately models bottom as two
  ordinary ctors) for safety already bought. Leave as-is.
- **B5 extraction notes (kept).** `Order.lean` (subsumption) is a DELIBERATE test-only oracle
  (imported only by `Tests/*`), NOT dead code and NOT duplicated — `meet` (join) and `subsumes`
  (partial order) are orthogonal. Recorded so a future audit does not re-flag it as an orphan.
