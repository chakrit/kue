# Kue Plan

The live implementation roadmap. Kept small, current, and actionable — one focused slice
at a time. The full record of completed slices lives in
[`../reference/implementation-log.md`](../reference/implementation-log.md), retained for
verification; this file holds only where we are and what's next. Distilled 2026-06-18 back
to the live roadmap (history moved to the log + git); a periodic plan-hygiene pass keeps it
lean (see [`../guides/slice-loop.md`](../guides/slice-loop.md)).

## North Star

Kue targets **CUE v0.15 semantics, done correctly**. Where the official `cue` v0.15
binary is buggy, Kue should implement the *correct* behavior, not replicate the bug. The
compatibility target is the language as specified, not bug-for-bug parity with the
reference implementation. See
[`../decisions/2026-06-14-cue-compatibility-target.md`](../decisions/2026-06-14-cue-compatibility-target.md).

## Working Principles

- Use TDD where behavior is testable: write theorem checks or executable examples
  before implementation.
- Keep the semantic model simple before optimizing representation.
- Prefer total functions and explicit semantic values over hidden host-language
  failure.
- Avoid dependencies until they clearly remove more complexity than they add.
- Keep each commit small enough to review, revert, or extend safely. One slice per
  commit; the commit subject mirrors the slice title.
- **Correctness over performance.** A latent unsound result is a Violation even with no
  failing fixture; a perf miss is acceptable. See
  [`../decisions/`](../decisions/).

## Standing Capabilities (what Kue does now)

The semantic core is broad and oracle-checked against `cue` v0.16.1
(`/Users/chakrit/go/bin/cue`). Currently working, cue-exact (modulo the tracked
field-ordering byte-parity gap, #3 in the backlog):

- **Evaluator + lattice.** Total `meet`/`join` over the full `Value` domain; primitives,
  kinds, bounds, regex, struct/list shapes. `Field` is a `structure`. Disjunctions with
  default-mark algebra (unification ANDs default sets; arithmetic/comparison/unary
  resolve-operand-first; nested two-level precedence; equal-default dedup).
- **Closures / cross-package def-meet.** `Value.closure (frame) (body)` carries the
  capture frame so an imported def's body unifies with the use-site *before* its
  cross-frame self/sibling refs resolve. Deep/nested self-ref detection
  (`hasSelfRefAtDepth`) defers `spec: acme: email: Self.#email` and comprehension guards;
  multi-level embed chains (`#ClusterIssuer → parts.#Metadata → attr.#Metadata`) resolve.
  Forcing tier closes imported def bodies at capture.
- **Comprehensions.** Struct (`for k,v in s {…}`) and list (`[for x in xs {x}]`, incl.
  `if` guards, nested/multi/zero-yield, plain+comp interleave). Scalar struct-embedding
  collapse (`{5}`→`5`) at embed-eval, so list-comp bodies and `{5}` shapes work; empty/
  decl-free struct ∩ scalar correctly conflicts.
- **Disjunction defaults under embedding.** Use-site narrowing distributes into every arm
  of an embedded default disjunction, pruning dead arms (a dead default falls through to a
  surviving arm).
- **Fuel-saturation perf.** Eval count is FLAT across fuel (bracketed monotonic
  truncation counter; truncated values stay fuel-keyed, saturated results go fuel-free).
  `evalFuel = 100`. Frame-id sharing + force-memo (partial).
- **Builtins.** `base64.Encode`, `json.Marshal` (`Kue/Json.lean`), `yaml.Marshal`
  (`Kue/Yaml.lean`), `strings.*`/`list.*`/`math.*` hardcoded namespaces. Multiline
  strings (`"""`/`'''`).
- **Imports / modules.** `cue.mod` discovery, in-module + cross-module (vendored or
  extract-cache) resolution by longest module-path prefix, multi-file package merge,
  transitive loads, package-dir entry (`kue export ./apps`). IO confined to
  `Kue/Module.lean`; `Eval`/`Resolve` stay pure. (Registry/OCI fetch — B3d — deferred; not
  needed for prod9, which is fully on-disk and resolves offline.)
- **CLI.** `kue eval`, `kue export [--out yaml|json] [file|dir]` (stdin or arg), clean
  missing-file diagnostics + exit codes.

**Real-app status** (prod9 infra, read-only oracle):
- **cert-manager: content-identical drop-in, ~31s.** Exports correctly at production fuel.
- **argocd: correct through link 2** (`defs.#Secret` populated base64 `data`,
  content-identical to cue; cert-manager + link-2 no regression). **Blocked on link 3**
  (`#TLSRoute` — see backlog item 1, the live blocker; capability is in place).

## Live Backlog (open work, ranked)

Correctness gates real-app adoption; cleanups are parallel-safe filler. Sequence:
correctness frontier (1) → parallel-safe cleanups (3,4,5) interleaved → deeper parity/perf
(2,6,7) → borderline/LOW (8) as opportunistic ride-alongs.

1. **`argocd-tlsroute-list-guard` (HIGH — LIVE real-app blocker; argocd link 3).**
   `#TLSRoute.spec.parentRefs` is a LIST whose elements are `if Self.#x != _|_ {…}` guards
   over use-site-narrowed hidden fields → bottom. The list analog of the struct-comprehension
   narrowing fix. List-comp parse+eval and def-deferral machinery are in place; what's
   missing is the same narrowing-before-guard-eval discipline applied to LIST-element `if`
   guards inside a force-spliced def. The minimal self-contained repro now PASSES in kue;
   the real `defs.#TLSRoute` bottoms from ADDITIONAL structure — bisect the real def
   (scratch-module method, breadcrumb) to find what the minimal shape misses. Fast-failing
   (~3-4s), NOT the perf wall. This is the next correctness link to make argocd a drop-in.

2. **`truncate-primitive` (HIGH — soundness hardening, Phase B step 1).** The
   truncation-bump invariant (a `fuel=0` helper that drops fields MUST bump `truncCount`)
   is currently held by DISCIPLINE across six sites. Step 1 (do now): add
   `EvalState.truncate` combinator fusing bump+return; rewrite all six sites — strictly
   behavior-preserving, byte-identical fixtures, localizes the bump to one definition.
   Step 2 (only if cheap): a `withFuel` combinator routing the `fuel=0` dispatch so a
   seventh helper physically cannot skip the bump — attempt only for the four
   top-level-`fuel`-dispatch helpers; STOP at step 1 + a one-line doc invariant if step 2's
   restructuring exceeds mechanical. Priority HIGH: this is the illegal-states-unrepresentable
   reason-to-be and the audit-#6 corruption it prevents already shipped once latent.

3. **Regex extraction → `Kue/Regex.lean` (ACTIONABLE, PARALLEL-SAFE).** The ~240-line
   engine (`Value.lean`, `RegexAtom` + fuel-bounded matcher + alternation/group expansion)
   depends only on `Char`/`String`, is consumed by `Eval`/`Builtin` only, sits below the
   closure ctor in `Value.lean`. Extracting makes `Value.lean` a TRUE leaf (drops the lone
   `Init.Data.String.Search` import). New leaf module + `import Kue.Regex` in `Eval`/`Builtin`.
   Zero conflict with any `Eval.lean` slice — runs in its own subagent concurrently.

4. **EvalOps extraction → `Kue/EvalOps.lean` (ACTIONABLE).** ~256 lines of self-contained
   pure `{Value, Decimal}` scalar algebra (`evalAdd…evalBinary`, ~lines 369-635) carved out
   from under the recursive evaluator. New module imports only `{Value, Decimal}`. No
   line-number collision with `truncate-primitive` (mutual block, ~1471+) or argocd work
   (closure/conj path, below 635) — interleaves freely. Mechanical.

5. **Test-org pass (ACTIONABLE, periodic).** Theorem modules in `Kue/Tests/` are oversized
   (`EvalTests` 1700+, `FixtureTests` 1033, `BuiltinTests` 735, `StructTests` 765). Split
   each by subsystem in ONE pass; leave `FixturePorts` whole (generated). Don't churn
   `testdata/` (sensibly named). Run AFTER the next correctness slice lands its pins so the
   split doesn't immediately stale.

6. **Field-ordering parity #3 (MEDIUM, DEEP — byte-parity vs cue).** cue orders
   `ref & {own}` own-fields-first; kue is left-struct-first (`mergeStructFieldsWith`,
   `Lattice.lean`). cue's rule tracks where each label is *first introduced* across
   conjuncts in eval order — faithful replication needs a per-`Field` introduction-provenance
   key threaded through every merge/manifest site, not a one-line fold flip. The byte-order
   tail between cert-manager content-match and byte-exact cue; affects the dominant
   `#Def & {…}` prod9 pattern's exported order. Multi-slice + a provenance-key design spike
   first. Do AFTER argocd unless it blocks a needed fixture.

7. **Per-eval-cost perf (frontier #2, downstream of correctness).** The heavy `argo`
   sub-package (`argo_.{stage9,bluepages,…}.configs`) times out >200s once past the early
   bottom; cert-manager has a ~31s residual. Root is exponential frame-id divergence —
   structurally-identical re-pushes get fresh ids, defeating the memo `envIds` key. Fix is
   frame-id sharing / canonical frame identity (same fields + same parent id-stack → reuse
   id), audit-heavy (must not violate "independently-built frames never falsely share").
   Profile against a resolving target after the correctness links land. Frame-id sharing +
   force-memo are partially landed; finish them here.

8. **Borderline / LOW (opportunistic; none block adoption).**
   - **`scalar-embed-with-decls`** — `{#a:1, 5}`→`5` (cue manifests `5`, keeps `.#a`
     selectable); kue bottoms. Incompleteness, not unsound. Needs a scalar-with-decls
     carrier (the `.embeddedList` analog for scalars). Do NOT "fix" item-relate by widening
     the scalar collapse — that is the unsound direction.
   - **`module-file-scoped-imports`** (arch-sized) — kue merges every sibling file's import
     bindings into one shared package frame; CUE scopes them per-file. Bites only the
     same-NAME-different-target case (which dedupe turned silent-wrong); real prod9 doesn't
     hit it. Bind each file's imports into a per-file scope frame.
   - **`import-eager-closedness`** (MEDIUM) — an imported plain closed `.struct` def met
     with extra fields admits them on the EAGER selector path (the force path closes
     correctly). Close imported def bodies at load, or route the eager path through
     `normalizeDefinitionValueWithFuel`. Pin both silent-admit and incomplete-mask facets.
   - **`scalar-embed` provenance follow-ups** — opportunistic pins (3-level flatten, disj
     ops beyond `+`/`&`, composed select-into-F1-default) when next touching Lattice/Eval.
   - **Parser strictness** — `*(1|2)` laxity (cue rejects at parse); `__x` double-underscore
     accepted (cue reserves `__`-prefixed idents). Track under a parser-strictness pass.
   - **Dead OR-branch `refsSelfEmbeddedLabel` (`Eval.lean:97`)** — the `… || refsSelfEmbeddedLabel
     … (.refId id)` recursion hits `_ => false` unconditionally (no `.refId` arm). Remove on
     the next embedding-Self touch.
   - **DRY `selectEvaluatedField .disj`** — the resolved-default arm re-lists the 5-arm
     struct-shape dispatch; collapse to `match resolveDisjDefault? alternatives with | some
     v => selectEvaluatedField v label | none => …` (gains free nested-disjunction recursion).
   - **`resolveEmbeddedDisjDefault` (`Eval.lean:2093`, next-audit confirm)** — verify the
     pass-1 label-surfacing path does NOT also need the use-site-narrowing distribution that
     `embed-disj-arm-fallthrough` added, or that label-surfacing-only is correct there.
