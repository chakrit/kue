# Kue Plan

The live implementation roadmap. Kept small, current, and actionable — one focused slice
at a time. The full record of completed slices lives in
[`../reference/implementation-log.md`](../reference/implementation-log.md), retained for
verification; this file holds only where we are and what's next.

## North Star

Kue targets **CUE v0.15 semantics, done correctly**. Where the official `cue` v0.15
binary is buggy, Kue should implement the *correct* behavior, not replicate the bug. The
compatibility target is the language as specified, not bug-for-bug parity with the
reference implementation. See
[`../decisions/2026-06-14-cue-compatibility-target.md`](../decisions/2026-06-14-cue-compatibility-target.md).

## Working Principles

- Use TDD where behavior is testable: write theorem checks or executable examples
  before implementation.
- Keep the semantic model simple before optimizing representation.
- Prefer total functions and explicit semantic values over hidden host-language
  failure.
- Avoid dependencies until they clearly remove more complexity than they add.
- Keep each commit small enough to review, revert, or extend safely. One slice per
  commit; the commit subject mirrors the slice title.

## Implementation Status

The semantic core, evaluator, manifestation, a stdin/file CLI, and a broad expression
layer are in place. Summary of standing capabilities (detail per slice in the
implementation log):

- **Value domain** — top, bottom (with structural provenance), primitives
  (int/float/number/string/bytes/bool/null), kinds, integer bounds (incl. strict),
  primitive exclusions, disjunctions with default markers.
- **Lattice** — total `meet`/`join` with normalization; recursive compound meets through
  structs, lists, conjunctions, and disjunction alternatives; numeric-kind hierarchy in
  meet and join.
- **Structs** — regular/optional/required/hidden/definition field classes, field-level
  bottom, open/closed structs, typed and untyped tails, definition-implied closedness,
  `close` builtin, and string/exact/regex pattern constraints (incl. multiple independent
  patterns).
- **Lists** — closed lists and typed open-list tails, element-wise meet.
- **References & cycles** — same-struct and nested-scope resolution via binding ids,
  `let` bindings, static field aliases, and bounded cycle handling (direct, mutual,
  longer; constraints preserved across cycles).
- **Comprehensions** — `for k, v in expr` / `for v in expr` / `if cond` field clauses,
  desugaring into fields merged into the enclosing struct; the loop variable is one
  further lexical scope frame, expansion runs at eval time over lists and struct values.
- **Dynamic fields & interpolation** — `(expr): v` computed labels and `"\(expr)"`
  string interpolation. Dynamic fields ride the `structComp` scope machinery, resolving
  their label expr in the enclosing struct's frame and expanding to a concrete field at
  eval time once the label is a string; interpolated labels (`"\(k)": v`) are the common
  form. Interpolation coerces int/float/bool/null/string holes to their CUE spelling.
- **Struct embeddings** — a `{ … }` (or any value) embedded directly in a struct
  resolves its body against the *enclosing* struct's lexical frame and unifies (`meet`)
  into it. Plain embeddings ride the same `structComp` `comprehensions` bucket as
  comprehensions and dynamic fields; a struct embedding merges its fields (collisions
  meet), a non-struct embedding conflicts to bottom.
- **Manifestation** — structured export with default selection (incl. nested),
  field-class filtering, and incompleteness/ambiguity rejection.
- **Builtins** — top-level `close`, `len`, `and`, `or`, `div`, `mod`, `quo`, `rem`, plus
  the package-qualified `strings` family (`Contains`, `HasPrefix`, `HasSuffix`, `Index`,
  `Count`, `Split`, `Join`, `Replace`, `Repeat`, `TrimSpace`, `Fields`) and the `list`
  family (`Concat`, `FlattenN`, `Repeat`, `Range`, `Slice`, `Take`, `Drop`, `Contains`,
  and integer-domain `Sum`/`Min`/`Max`). Unresolved calls preserved as semantic values;
  concrete type-mismatch args resolve to bottom.
- **Parser/CLI** — recursive-descent parser over the supported subset; numeric literal
  spellings (non-decimal, separators, exponents, suffix multipliers); stdin and explicit
  multi-file evaluation with package-name consistency. Package-qualified builtin calls
  (`strings.X(...)`) parse via call-on-selector; `import` clauses (single and grouped)
  parse and are ignored since the package is implicit in the dotted builtin name.
- **Expressions** — unary/additive/multiplicative/division/integer-keyword arithmetic,
  equality, ordering, numeric comparison across int/float, logical `&&`/`||`/`!`, and
  binary regex match `=~`/`!~`.

Known deliberate boundaries are tracked in [`compat-assumptions.md`](compat-assumptions.md).

## Later Slices

- Expand pattern constraints beyond the current string-label representation:
  non-string label patterns and fuller regular expression matching.
- Add remaining alias positions in a syntax layer instead of constructing
  semantic values directly.
- Expand cycle handling for arithmetic cycles and richer validation behavior.
- **Builtin families.** Top-level helpers, the `strings` package, and the `list`
  package (integer domain) are landed (see Implementation Status). **Next: the `math`
  family.** Remaining `list` work, deferred by design choice and noted in the
  implementation log: `list.Avg` (exact-rational mean with apd 34-sig-digit float
  formatting); float-domain `Sum`/`Min`/`Max` and float `Range` (need the decimal
  arithmetic in `Eval` lifted to a lower module — Builtin can't import Eval without a
  cycle); and `Sort`/`SortStable`/`SortStrings` (need comparator-struct evaluation).
  Then the deferred `strings` functions that need unicode case folding
  (`ToUpper`/`ToLower`/`ToTitle`) or are otherwise unimplemented (`SplitN`,
  `Trim`/`TrimPrefix`/`TrimSuffix`, `Runes`, `ContainsAny`, `LastIndex`, …). Each is
  oracle-checked against `cue` v0.16.1; the package-qualified dispatch (call-on-selector
  → dotted `.builtinCall` name) is in place, so a new family is an `evalXBuiltin` helper,
  a catch-all route in `evalBuiltinCall`, a fixture, and unit theorems.
- Add imports and full module resolution after the syntax and resolver layers exist.
