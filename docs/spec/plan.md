The live implementation roadmap. Kept small, current, and actionable — one focused slice
at a time. The full record of completed slices lives in
[`implementation-log.md`](implementation-log.md) (chronological,
one entry per commit) and `git log`; this file holds only where we are and what's next. A
periodic plan-hygiene pass distills it back to the live roadmap (history → log + git); see
[`../guides/slice-loop.md`](../guides/slice-loop.md). Last distilled 2026-07-04.

## North Star

Kue targets **CUE v0.15 semantics, done correctly**. Where the official `cue` v0.16.1
binary is buggy, Kue implements the *correct* behavior, not the bug. The compatibility
target is the language as specified, not bug-for-bug parity. See
[`../decisions/2026-06-14-cue-compatibility-target.md`](../decisions/2026-06-14-cue-compatibility-target.md).

## Working Principles

- TDD where behavior is testable: theorem checks or executable examples before code.
- Keep the semantic model simple before optimizing representation.
- Total functions and explicit semantic values over hidden host-language failure.
- Avoid dependencies until they clearly remove more complexity than they add.
- One slice per commit; subject mirrors the slice title. Small enough to review/revert.
- **Correctness over performance.** A latent unsound result is a Violation even with no
  failing fixture; a perf miss is acceptable. See [`../decisions/`](../decisions/).
- **Spec is the authority; `cue` is a fallible cross-check, never the gate.**
  Byte-identical to `cue` is structurally bug-replicating. Conform to the CUE spec; where
  it is silent, to lattice first principles (precise, total,
  illegal-states-unrepresentable). When `cue` disagrees with the spec it is WRONG → follow
  the spec, record in `cue-divergences.md`.
- **No configuration corpus is the goal or the test strategy.** The target is
  spec-conformance and robustness across the whole language + stdlib surface; the test
  strategy is spec-conformance fixtures + first-principles edge coverage, not getting any
  real config to `export`. Rank slices by spec-correctness and clean design evolution.
  Never special-case a config's shape — a fix is always a GENERAL semantic fix, oracle-pinned
  at single-package granularity (the Bug2-5..2-14c chain landed exactly this way — each fix
  general, no app-keyed code). If a real-world input ever surfaces a bug, it enters as a
  spec-adjudicated `wild/` fixture — an incidental bug source, never a target to please.

## List-embed, default-disjunction & def-closedness fixes (L1–L5) — COMPLETE (2026-07-03)

A cluster of embedded-disjunction / list-carrier / def-closedness defects, each captured as a
self-contained `testdata/wild/` fixture (reproduced RED first) and fixed with a GENERAL,
spec-grounded change, left gate-enforced green. All resolved:

- **L1 — Self.#hidden in list embeddings** (`self-hidden-in-list-embed`). The embedding-`Self`
  two-pass scanned only static fields; now re-evaluates embeddings against the augmented frame
  when an embedding reads a sibling-embedded `Self.<L>`.
- **L2 — default-disjunction not concretized in string interpolation**
  (`default-disj-in-interpolation`). `.map collapseDefaultDisjunction` over evaluated
  interpolation parts, reusing the shared default-shedding projection.
- **L3 — let/ref-delivered list-carrier meet bottomed** (`let-list-meets-carrier`). Fixed at
  the EVAL layer (a list-embedding collapse mirroring the `{5}`→`5` scalar collapse), NOT meet.
  **Provenance is the soundness key:** the host's OWN embedding collapses; a SEPARATE foreign
  decls-struct conjunct (`{#a,[1,2]} & {#b}`) still bottoms, matching cue — a meet-layer fix
  would have over-collapsed it (the red herring this slice ruled out).
- **Root A — def closedness through embedded disjunction** (`def-closedness-thru-embedded-disj`).
  A SOUNDNESS over-accept: a definition embedding a structural disjunction lost closedness
  through the arms. The closing normalizer now recurses into a `.disj` embedding so each
  struct-literal arm closes; a `.refId`/non-disj embedding is a no-op pass-through. Prerequisite
  that unblocked L4.
- **L4 — disj-arm-list-embed dropped** (`disj-arm-list-embed-dropped`). A list-shaped
  disjunction arm met against a list-carrier host bottomed as struct-vs-list → arm pruned →
  spurious bottom. Now, when the plain meet bottoms AND the arm is list-shaped, re-run it through
  the single-embedding sub-fold so the host's own list-collapse fires. Root A + L4 are a pair.
- **L5 — three closedness seeds graduated** (all `.known-red` removed): root2/root3 were a
  MEASUREMENT artifact (the carrier was bound as a regular exported field, so its own
  incompleteness surfaced before `out`'s bottom; corrected to a hidden `#M`), and webapp-carrier-l5
  was `evaluatedStructOperand?` (`Kue/EvalBase.lean`) mis-closing an OPEN open-tail operand.
  Dropping the `.defOpenViaTail → false` special case (open now contributes `openness.isOpen`;
  closedness still ANDs) fixed it without under-rejecting a genuinely-closed sibling.

**Durable ruling:** every fix was general and oracle-pinned at single-package granularity —
none keyed to a specific config (the Bug2-5..2-14c discipline). Full bisection trails +
adversarial pins live in `implementation-log.md` + git; the soundness argument lives at each
wild fixture.

## Standing Capabilities (what Kue does now)

The semantic core is broad and oracle-checked against `cue` v0.16.1
(`/Users/chakrit/go/bin/cue`); the current front is spec/stdlib-surface coverage. Currently
working, cue-exact modulo the tracked field-ordering byte-parity gap (#3):

- **Evaluator + lattice.** Total `meet` /`join` over the full `Value` domain; primitives,
  kinds, bounds, regex, struct/list shapes. `Field` is a `structure`. Disjunctions with
  default-mark algebra (unification ANDs default sets; arithmetic/comparison/unary
  resolve-operand-first; nested two-level precedence; equal-default dedup).
  Structural-cycle detection: `#L:{n,next:#L}` errors; `#List | *null` terminates on
  `*null` (D#2).
  ```cue
  port: int & >0 & <=65535
  port: 8080  // 8080
  ```
- **Closures / cross-package def-meet.** `Value.closure (frame) (body)` carries the
  capture frame so an imported def's body unifies with the use-site *before* its
  cross-frame self/sibling refs resolve. Deep/nested self-ref detection
  (`hasSelfRefAtDepth`); multi-level embed chains resolve. Forcing tier closes imported
  def bodies at capture.
  ```cue
  import "ex.com/pkg"
  web: pkg.#Def & {name: "web"}
  ```
- **Comprehensions.** Struct (`for k,v in s {…}`) and list (`[for x in xs {x}]`, incl.
  `if` guards, `let` clauses (D#3), nested/multi/zero-yield, plain+comp interleave). Guard
  classification (D#1b/c): incomplete guard DEFERS (residual node), concrete non-bool
  guard is a TYPE ERROR, presence-test `X !=/== _|_` drops. `for` over a concrete
  non-iterable is a TYPE ERROR (E#4); a `.top`/unresolved source DEFERS; a bottom source
  PROPAGATES (PA-1). Scalar struct-embedding collapse (`{5}`→`5`) at embed-eval.
  ```cue
  out: [for x in [1, 2, 3] {x * 2}]  // [2, 4, 6]
  ```
- **Pattern label aliases.** `[Name=string]: {n: Name}` binds `Name` to each matched field's label
  string, in scope within the (struct) constraint body. Parse desugars the `ident=` prefix onto a
  non-output `letBinding` carrying the `Value.patternLabel` placeholder; ordinary lexical resolution
  reaches it, and it is substituted to the matched label at pattern application. Multiple/nested +
  cross-scope aliases, top/comparator patterns all bind independently; `[x=~…]` stays a regex
  pattern. Non-struct constraint bodies (`[Name=string]: Name`) not yet supported
  (PATTERN-LABEL-ALIAS-SCALAR).
- **Disjunction defaults under embedding.** Use-site narrowing distributes into every arm
  of an embedded default disjunction, pruning dead arms.
  ```cue
  x: (*"a" | "b") & ("b" | "c")  // "b"
  ```
- **Fuel-saturation perf.** Eval count FLAT across fuel (bracketed monotonic truncation
  counter; truncated values fuel-keyed, saturated results fuel-free). `evalFuel = 100`.
  Frame-id sharing + force-memo. Cache keyed on a bounded-depth structural digest
  (`valueDigest`, `DIGEST_DEPTH=3`; `BEq` untouched → soundness unconditional). Perf #7
  (2026-06-23) added a `selfEvaluatingLeaf?` fast path (env-independent leaves bypass the
  cache) + saturated-only `satCache` insert — both value-identical by construction.
- **Builtins.** `base64.Encode`, `json.Marshal` (`Kue/Json.lean`), `yaml.Marshal`
  (`Kue/Yaml.lean`), `regexp.Match`, `math.Pow`/`math.Sqrt` (full real domain, exact decimal),
  `list.Sort` /`SortStable`, `strings.*` /`list.*`/`math.*` namespaces. Multiline strings.
  Dispatch is via a closed `BuiltinFamily` enum (`core` + the 7 qualified packages) classified
  by `BuiltinFamily.ofName?` and matched EXHAUSTIVELY — a non-builtin name bottoms on concrete
  args (no silent residual); a new family forces a dispatch arm (TL-1).
  ```cue
  import "encoding/json"
  out: json.Marshal({a: 1})  // "{\"a\":1}"
  ```
- **Regex.** RE2-equivalent AST → NFA matcher in `Kue/Regex.lean` (a true leaf), incl.
  `\b`, lazy quantifiers, in-class `\D` /`\W`/`\S` set-complement, `maxRepeat=1000`.
  Corpus divergence-free.
- **Imports / modules.** `cue.mod` discovery, in-module + cross-module (vendored or
  extract-cache) resolution by longest module-path prefix, multi-file merge, transitive
  loads, package-dir entry (`kue export./apps`), qualified import path
  `"location:identifier"` (F-3, `Import.packageName`). Imports are FILE-SCOPED (a sibling
  file's imports are invisible; same-named imports occupy separate slots — `53fe3cc`).
  Registry/OCI fetch-on-missing (B3d, live-proven incl. bearer-token auth against `ghcr.io`).
  IO confined to `Kue/Module.lean` + `Kue/OciFetch.lean`; `Eval` /`Resolve` stay pure.
- **Load-time validation.** Import-name redeclaration (A2-y) and `let`/alias vs
  bare/hidden-field shadow across comparable scopes — BOTH directions (forward `e20af9a`;
  reverse via `Field.quoted`, 2026-07-04) — are rejected at parse/load with cue's message;
  parser strictness (`*(1|2)`, `__x`) spec-mandated rejects.
- **CLI.** `kue eval`, `kue export [--out yaml|json] [file|dir]` (stdin or arg), `kue
  version`, clean missing-file diagnostics + exit codes.

A large real config exports content-identical at production fuel (~11.7s), byte-identical to
`cue` modulo field-order #3, and runs IN-GATE via `scripts/check-realworld.sh` (sanitized,
self-contained fixture). The Bug2-5 → Bug2-14c chain (2026-06-22..23) that hardened this path
— definition multi-declaration close-once across reference / embed / cross-package boundaries,
use-site narrowing delivery to deferred def interiors, unset-optional selection, and the
structural-disjunction let-local narrowing (Bug2-14b/c) — is HISTORY (`implementation-log.md`,
`git log`). Durable rulings that survived it are in Resolved/ruled-out below.

## Live Backlog (open work, ranked)

Correctness gates adoption; cleanups are parallel-safe filler. This plan owns the single
authoritative **spec-conformance fixes** ranked backlog (below). Everything spec-conformance-HIGH is
DONE (the closedness family incl. SC-1b/1e + EMBED-CLOSE-1, the MEET-RESID-1/A#6 family, the
dyn-field family, D-area, regex, BI-1/BI-2, E#4, F-1/2/3, SC-4, Bug2-12 MUTUAL, EvalOps).
**NESTED-DISJ-MARK is CLOSED (2026-07-05): Kue was already SPEC-CORRECT; `cue` is the buggy
side.** The former "lone open VALUE divergence / DESIGNED-DEFERRAL 2026-06-23" was mis-adjudicated
— applying the spec's default-marking rule **M2** (`*⟨v, d⟩ => ⟨v, d⟩`: a mark on an
already-defaulted disjunct is ABSORBED, it does NOT re-broaden the inner default) + **U1**
(`d1 & v2` for the default under a narrow) mandates the AMBIGUOUS result Kue already produces;
`cue`'s resolved value comes from an M2-violating broadening (a `cue` bug). NO Kue code change; the
designed 3rd-`Mark`-state fix is WITHDRAWN (it would have imported `cue`'s bug). Reclassified from
`cue-spec-gaps.md` to `cue-divergences.md` (M2/U1 basis). With this, **there are ZERO open
VALUE-level divergences.** **SC-3** is a display-only spec-gap (multi-arm-default display
divergence; a 2026-07-04 AFK sweep of the whole disjunction/default area confirmed ZERO export
divergence and recorded the all-default `*1 | *2` display as an SC-3 sub-case — guards
`EvalTests` `disj_meet_*`). Full records: `cue-spec-gaps.md`.

**perf #7 frame-sharing across env-DEPENDENT evals — WON'T-FIX (2026-06-23,
measurement-driven).** A zero-risk content-addressed shadow measured the share ceiling at
0.045% and 0.059% across two large real configs. The ~175× re-eval is real but NOT content-redundant (the
same shape is reached under genuinely-different observable bindings), so no sound frame-sharing
reclaims it — the residual wall is the irreducible cost of distinct content. Full data +
rejection argument: `kue-performance.md` + implementation-log.

### Ranked OPEN backlog

**DEF-CLOSEDNESS-INDIRECT-DISJ-CONJ ✅ LANDED (2026-07-13) — both faces, one structural fold.**
[RETRACTION 2026-07-13, FINAL Phase A milestone-verdict audit: the "closed BY CONSTRUCTION"
claim is FALSIFIED — a 6th residual (DEF-CLOSEDNESS-CONJ-DISJ-REFERENT, ranked HEAD below)
survives the fold. `resolveDefBodyReferent` normalizes a disjunction only when a `.refId`
resolves DIRECTLY to a `.disj`; a disjunction reached as a MEMBER of a resolved `.conj`
referent bypasses. The fold unified the struct-referent and pure-disjunction-referent
paths, NOT a conj-of-disj referent. Milestone NOT substantiated.]
The closedness-through-indirection class is closed for struct and pure-disjunction referents;
a conj-of-disj referent still leaks.
`resolveDefBodyReferent` (`EvalBase.lean`) resolves each non-def indirection conjunct of a def body
to its OWN-content value BEFORE the closedness gate: a struct referent inlines OPEN (unions ONCE via
the existing own-literal-union — Face B admits `#X: a0 & b0` ⇒ `{a,b}`, no separate closedClauses),
a disjunction referent inlines CLOSED per arm (self-contained, as a direct `.disj` body — Face A
`#X: foo`, `foo: {a}|{b}` distributes closedness, the extra rejects every arm). A DEFINITION referent
(`#Base`) is LEFT as the `.refId` so the meet composes its own closedness (open-extension unchanged).
The two closedness paths are UNIFIED: indirect bodies flow through the SAME
`ownLiteralUnion`/`disjArmCrossProduct` machinery a direct body does — no parallel indirection-close
to diverge. This UNIFIES what had spawned five consecutive residuals + one regression; the old
per-shape `underDef` struct pre-close (the Face B over-reject root) is DELETED, proven dead by full
`check.sh` green. Face B was indeed a 68c4879 regression (non-def referents were closed separately),
now fixed. 13 `ClosednessTests defflatten_indirect_*` theorems (both faces + siblings +
struct-over-disj distribute + def-ref-compose / def-ref-to-nondef-chain / direct-disj / non-def
enclosing guards); both seeds RED→GREEN; full `check.sh` green, zero L-series/Bug2/closedness/cycle
flips. cue v0.16.1 adjudicates every face identically. **The disj-referent seed uses a HIDDEN `_foo`
to isolate CLOSEDNESS** — a plain exported `foo` is an ambiguous top-level disjunction whose own
"ambiguous value" export error MASKS `y`'s bottom, an orthogonal export-error-precedence bug filed
below (EXPORT-ERR-BOTTOM-PRECEDENCE) and captured red-first.

**DEF-CLOSEDNESS-CONJ-DISJ-REFERENT (HIGH soundness — SILENT closedness over-acceptance; 6th
closedness-through-indirection residual; FINAL Phase A milestone-verdict audit 2026-07-13). RANKED
HEAD. MILESTONE NOT substantiated.** A definition indirecting to a CONJUNCTION one of whose members
is a DISJUNCTION (`#X: _foo`, `_foo: (disj) & struct`) does NOT distribute the def's closedness
across the disjunction arms — the arms inline OPEN and admit a use-site extra. Clean over-accept:
`_foo: (*{a:1}|{b:2}) & {c:3}` · `#X: _foo` · `y: #X & {a:1,c:3,q:99}` ⇒ kue emits
`{a:1,c:3,q:99}` (leaks `q`); cue v0.16.1 rejects (empty disjunction, `a`/`q` field not allowed).
Over-reject face: `_foo: ({a:1}|{b:2}) & {c:3}`, `y: #X & {a:1,c:3}` ⇒ kue "ambiguous value"; cue
resolves `{a:1,c:3}`. **Root:** `resolveDefBodyReferent` (`EvalBase.lean` ~2099) normalizes a
disjunction only in the `.refId → .disj` arm (`normalizeDefinitionValueWithFuel`); when the
disjunction is a MEMBER of a resolved `.conj` referent, the `.conj cs => .conj (cs.map …)` recursion
maps over members and a bare `.disj` member hits the `| _ => v` fall-through — returned
UNNORMALIZED, so it never reaches the distributable closed form the gate's `disjArmCrossProduct`
expects. The DIRECT body `#X: (disj) & struct` splits to top-level conjuncts `[.disj, {c}]` and
closes correctly; only the indirection buries the disj inside a `.conj` conjunct. **Fix:** route
disjunction members reached through `resolveDefBodyReferent`'s `.conj` recursion through the SAME
`normalizeDefinitionValueWithFuel` the direct `.refId → .disj` arm applies (so a nested disj member
reaches the distributable closed form) — or, equivalently, splice the resolved `.conj`'s members up
to the top-level conjunct list so the disj lands as its own gate conjunct. Verify the fix preserves
the struct-referent (Face B) and pure-disj (Face A) fixtures and the def-ref open-extension. Seed
`testdata/wild/def-closedness-conj-disj-referent` (`.known-red`, red-first, whole-file exportable).
FULL cross-surface sweep otherwise CLEAN (see log verdict entry): numbers, lists, strings/bytes,
structs, disjunction defaults, unification, close()/pattern/embedding/optional/required/hidden/
def-in-def closedness — all match cue v0.16.1; this is the SOLE residual.

**EXPORT-ERR-BOTTOM-PRECEDENCE (LOW — kue bug, cosmetic error selection; surfaced 2026-07-13 folding
indirection-close).** kue's manifest (`manifestFieldsWithFuel`) walks top-level fields in SOURCE
order and short-circuits on the FIRST field that errors, so an EXPORTED incomplete field (unresolved
disjunction) declared before a hard CONTRADICTION field MASKS the bottom: kue reports "ambiguous
value", cue reports the contradiction regardless of order (a hard bottom is the dominant export
error). Both exit nonzero — a WRONG error MESSAGE, not a wrong value. Fix: export error selection
should prefer a `.contradiction` over an `.incomplete`/`.ambiguous` sibling rather than
short-circuit. Separate blast radius across error-message fixtures — not a closedness concern. Seed
`testdata/wild/export-error-bottom-precedence` (`.known-red`, red-first).

**~~DEF-CLOSEDNESS-INDIRECT-DISJ-CONJ~~ (superseded by the LANDED entry above — original diagnosis
retained for provenance).** The 68c4879 `underDef` indirection-close path closes a SINGLE non-def
struct referent correctly but does not compose over the referent's own disjunction/conjunction
structure, leaving two residuals (both quarantined `.known-red` seeds, red-first):
- **Face A — disjunction referent LEAKS (SOUNDNESS over-accept).** A def indirecting to a
  disjunction of structs (`#X: foo`, `foo: {a:1} | {b:2}`, hidden or plain field) does not
  distribute the def's closedness across arms — both arms inline OPEN and a use-site extra
  (`#X & {z:9}`) leaks into every arm. cue v0.16.1 rejects (empty disjunction). Direct
  `#X: {a:1} | {b:2}` closes correctly — only the indirection leaks. Seed
  `testdata/wild/def-closedness-disj-referent`. This is exactly the leak class the milestone
  claimed closed.
- **Face B — conjunction-of-referents OVER-REJECTS (completeness).** A def whose body is a
  conjunction reaching non-def struct referents (`#X: a0 & b0`, or mixed `a0 & {b:2}`) closes
  EACH referent separately → two independent closedClauses; a use-site meet then requires every
  field in BOTH sets and bottoms a legitimately-declared field (`y: #X & {a:1}` ⇒ `y.b` ⊥;
  cue ⇒ `{a:1,b:2}`). Likely a 68c4879 regression (previously non-def referents stayed open).
  Same root shows a `.selector`-to-disjunction referent (`#X: w.inner`) bottoming the WHOLE
  value. Direct literal conj `#X: {a:1} & {b:2}` closes once over the union (correct). Seed
  `testdata/wild/def-closedness-conj-referent-overclose`.
  Fix: route indirection-close through the SAME union-close-once / per-arm-distribute machinery
  the direct def-body path uses (Bug2-12b union; `.disj` arm distribution) rather than closing
  each referent independently. FULL SWEEP otherwise CLEAN (see log verdict entry): numbers
  (precision/big-int/bounds/quo/rem/div/mod), lists (ops/slice/concat/sort/comprehension),
  strings/bytes (interp/multiline/escapes/cmp), structs (comprehension/let/alias/embed),
  disjunction defaults (export-resolved identically; eval-display divergence benign),
  unification (ordering-insensitive, cycle→top) — all match cue v0.16.1.

**Phase B audit reconciliation (2026-07-13, post-`345f08b`; 3rd-cycle INFRA/GATES rotation + module
graph + backlog).** TASK 1 (DEF-CLOSEDNESS-NESTED-CONJ-ARM) landed above. Audit outcomes:
- **Gates/tooling — NO rot.** `check.sh` glob complete, shellcheck reaches all 9 `scripts/*.sh` +
  `./lake`/`./lean`. Every gate's greps re-verified against crafted positives: comment-history denylist
  (bans `formerly`/`before the fix`/`after the fix`/`the old` — deliberately NOT `no longer`),
  test-health block-comment reject + 1800 cap, wild-fixture `.known-red` THREE-STATE (enforce /
  skip-quarantined / graduation-hard-fail) all live. PB-VERSION-CONST reconfirmed OPEN (LOW, cosmetic
  self-id); PB-CHECK-COMMENT + PB-PERFGUIDE-STALE fixed inline this audit.
- **Module graph — clean DAG, NO dead code.** All 12 closedness helpers (incl. the new
  `flattenConjMembers`/`pureStructConjMembers`/`mergeDefBodyDisjArm`/`normalizeDefBodyConjunct`) have
  live callers. `EvalBase.lean` grew to **2909** (PB-EVALBASE-SPLIT unchanged: MED nav-debt, no
  core-module size gate; carve (a) `EvalScan.lean` or (c) closedness-cluster both clean seams).
- **Closedness architecture — DO NOT FOLD `isUnionableDefValue` into `disjArmClass` (durable ruling).**
  They answer DIFFERENT questions (coarse "struct-literal?" vs the 4-way distribution class) and agree
  on the struct case by construction — a coarsening, NOT the drift-prone duplication the nested-conj fix
  killed (that was a predicate and classifier that could *disagree*). Folding would inject
  `disjArmClass`'s `.builtinCall`→`evalBuiltinCall` evaluation into the hot pure-syntactic conjunct test
  — a regression. Optional VERY-LOW hardening: a `native_decide` pin
  `isUnionableDefValue v = (disjArmClass v == .fieldCarryingClosed)` guards struct-constructor drift
  without a signature change. Do not prioritize.
- **Ranked HEAD (autonomously-actionable):** the LOW correctness-gap cluster —
  **PATTERN-LABEL-ALIAS-SCALAR / UNREFERENCED-ALIAS (graduates its `.known-red` seed) / LIST-ISSORTED** —
  cheap, parallel-safe, closes real spec-conformance gaps; then PB-EVALBASE-SPLIT (carve (a)) as
  nav-debt filler. Float feature-completion (F1→F3→F5) leads on completeness but is chakrit-GATED.
  **DEF-BODY-CLOSEDNESS-UNIFY ✅ LANDED (2026-07-13) — the def-body closedness entry-path LEAK CLASS
  is now closed BY CONSTRUCTION: `defBodyConjuncts` routes every INDIRECT/COMPOSITIONAL def body
  (`.disj`/`.refId`/future indirection) through ONE normalization+flatten point; a new entry path
  cannot bypass. This landed DEF-CLOSEDNESS-REREF-DROP (3rd residual) and subsumes the per-arm
  bare-`.disj`/buried-self-ref patches. **DEF-COMPREHENSION-CONJUNCT-USESITE-BOTTOM ✅ LANDED
  (2026-07-13)** — the orthogonal over-REJECTION is closed too (`mergeCompDefBody` merges a
  comprehension+literal def body into ONE normalized `.structComp` that closes jointly, both-direction
  guards green).** **`DEF-CLOSEDNESS-NONDEF-REFERENT` ✅ LANDED (2026-07-13, below) — the last known
  closedness residual. The def-body-closedness entry-path leak CLASS is now FULLY closed: closedness
  keys on the ENCLOSING definition (`underDef`), not the referent, so every referent-kind (def,
  non-def struct, selector, index, chain) closes uniformly. Next-step ranking: milestone-verdict
  re-audit (rerun the FULL adversarial sweep — closedness + bounds/arithmetic/list/disjunction
  surfaces not exhaustively re-swept last pass — to confirm "all soundness leaks closed"; do NOT
  claim it from this slice) → the LOW correctness-gap cluster (PATTERN-LABEL-ALIAS-SCALAR /
  UNREFERENCED-ALIAS / LIST-ISSORTED) → PB-EVALBASE-SPLIT → chakrit-GATED float (F1→F3→F5).** Test health:
  BuiltinTests (1759) nearest
  the 1800 cap (PB-TESTORG-4); two `.known-red` seeds remain (`unreferenced-value-alias`,
  `byte-literal-interpolation`).

**DEF-CLOSEDNESS-NONDEF-REFERENT (HIGH soundness — SILENT closedness leak / over-acceptance;
2026-07-13 Phase A MILESTONE-VERDICT audit). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-13).** A definition whose body
INDIRECTS (bare `.refId`, `.selector`, `.index`) to a NON-definition struct now closes: the value of
a definition is closed HOWEVER reached, so the referent's def-ness is irrelevant. `_foo: {a:1}` ·
`#X: _foo` · `#X & {z:9}` ⇒ ⊥; `#X: _foo.bar`, `#X: _l[0]`, and chains through plain bindings
(`#X: _bar`, `_bar: _foo`, `_foo: {a:1}`) all close; nested closes recursively. Seed
`testdata/wild/def-closedness-nondef-referent/` graduated (`.known-red` removed). **Fix (two
coordinated mechanisms, keyed on the ENCLOSING definition, not the referent):** `flattenConjDefRef`
gained an `underDef` flag (true once expansion passes through a definition field). (1) A `.refId`/
struct chain: under a def, a non-def `.refId` binding is FOLLOWED and a non-def struct terminal is
close-and-inlined (`normalizeDefinitionValueWithFuel` — respects an explicit `...`, so an OPEN
referent stays open) — so the terminal struct enters `expanded` already closed and flows out. (2) A
`.selector`/`.index` def body (flatten cannot resolve a selection) is returned UNROUTED so the bare
use-site `.refId` survives to the `.refId` eval arm (`Kue/Eval.lean`), which — when the resolved
field is a definition with a bare-indirection body — closes the RESOLVED value (`closeResolved`).
Both-direction guards hold: def-referent regression (`#X: #Y`) unchanged; open-referent
(`_foo: {a:1,...}`) STAYS open; non-def enclosing (`_x: _foo`) STAYS open (closedness is def-only);
scalar referent (`#X: 5`) no-op; L-series / composition (`#LS: #Base & {…}`, a `.conj` body, not a
bare indirection) untouched. cue v0.16.1 adjudicates every face identically (no divergence).
9 `ClosednessTests defflatten_nondef_*` theorems + graduated seed; full `check.sh` green, zero
L-series / Bug2 / closedness / cycle flips. This COMPLETES the closedness-through-indirection class:
`close` no longer keys on the referent — every referent-kind (def, non-def struct, selector, index,
chain) closes uniformly because the enclosing definition drives it.

**DEF-CLOSEDNESS-NESTED-CONJ-ARM (HIGH soundness — SILENT closedness leak / over-acceptance; NEW,
2026-07-13 Phase A MILESTONE-RECONFIRMATION audit). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-13, Phase B — normal-form
fix `normalizeDefBodyConjunct`).** Both faces closed by a def-body NORMAL FORM applied BEFORE the
closedness gate (fix direction (b), the design-out-the-class option): `normalizeDefBodyConjunct`
(`Kue/EvalBase.lean`) SPLICES a pure-struct-literal `.conj` conjunct into its struct members
(`{a} & ({b}&{d})` → the flat `{a},{b},{d}` the own-literal union already closes) and MERGES a
`.disj` conjunct's pure-struct `.conj` arms into the single struct they denote (normalized-to-closed
first, then `mergeDefinitionDecls` — a raw regularOpen merge would union-OPEN via `unionDefOpenness`).
Neither `isUnionableDefValue` nor `disjArmClass` gained a `.conj` case; the special case is DELETED,
not duplicated. Fires ONLY for a DEFINITION body and ONLY for pure-struct-literal `.conj`s (associativity
⇒ semantics-preserving), so refs/scalars/self-refs/mutual-cycles/mixed `.conj`s stay byte-identical on
their existing paths — the buried-self-ref guard (`x: (x&int)&1`) is untouched (a `.conj` containing a
self-ref is impure → not spliced). Both wild seeds GREEN (conjunct + disjunction-arm faces);

+ DEF-CLOSEDNESS-NESTED-CONJ-ARM sections moved Bug2xTests→ClosednessTests (Bug2xTests was over the
1800-line test-health cap). ~~OPEN — MILESTONE NOT substantiated.~~ A
PARENTHESIZED (nested) `.conj`-of-struct-literals conjunct in a closed definition defeats the
own-literal-union close, leaving the def OPEN so a use-site extra field leaks. `#X: {a:1} & ({b:2} &
{d:4})` · `#X & {z:9}` ⇒ kue **`{a,b,d,z}`** (`kue export` succeeds, emits `z:9`), cue ⊥ (`z: field
not allowed`). The FLAT form `#X: {a:1} & {b:2} & {d:4}` closes correctly (single already-merged
`.conj [{a:1},{b:2},{d:4}]`, all `isUnionableDefValue`); the parens keep `{b:2} & {d:4}` a NESTED
`.conj`. **Root:** `isUnionableDefValue` (`Kue/EvalBase.lean:1814`) accepts `.struct`/`.structComp`
but NOT `.conj`, so `ownLiteralUnion`'s `cs.all` gate fails on the nested-conj conjunct → `close`
false → def flattens OPEN. Same root, disjunction face: `disjArmClass (.conj _) = .blocking`, so a
`.conj` disjunction arm is NOT distributed AND poisons its innocent struct-literal siblings' closedness
(`#X: {a:1} & (({b:2}&{d:4}) | {c:3})` · `#X & {z:9}` ⇒ kue admits `z` in BOTH arms; cue ⊥). This is
the residual the closedness-disjunction structural fixes (DISJ-CLOSEDNESS-DISTRIBUTE-STRUCTURAL) did
NOT reach — a DIFFERENT mechanism (nested `.conj` conjunct, not a disjunction arm shape). **Fix
direction:** recognize a `.conj` all of whose relevant conjuncts are field-carrying closables as
itself unionable/distributable — either (a) recurse `isUnionableDefValue`/`disjArmClass` through
`.conj` (a `.conj` of `.struct`/`.structComp` → merge-then-close, matching the flat-chain path), or
(b) FLATTEN nested `.conj` conjuncts into the def body before the own-literal-union gate so `{a:1} &
({b:2}&{d:4})` normalizes to the already-correct `[{a:1},{b:2},{d:4}]`. Prefer (b) if the normalize
seam is clean — it deletes the special case rather than adding a parallel one, and fixes the
disjunction face for free (a distributed `.conj` arm becomes its merged struct). Red seed:
`testdata/wild/def-closedness-nested-conj-arm/` (`.known-red`, no-disjunction core). Add both faces
(no-disj + disj-arm) as fixtures + `Bug2xTests` reject/select-admit guards; verify the flat-conj and
disjunction-of-plain-struct-arm controls stay green (regression guards — they already close).

**DEF-CLOSEDNESS-NESTED-CONJ-RESIDUAL (HIGH soundness — SILENT closedness leak / over-acceptance;
2026-07-13 Phase A MILESTONE-RECONFIRMATION audit). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-13).** The nested-conj-closedness
class is now closed across ALL def-body entry paths. Fix (`Kue/EvalBase.lean`): (a) a bare-`.disj`
DEFINITION body is routed through the same closedness machinery as a `.conj` body (a `defBodyConjuncts`
`Option (List Value)` treats a `.disj` def body as the single-conjunct list `[body]`; non-def disj bodies
keep their standalone path), so `normalizeDefBodyConjunct` merges each pure-struct `.conj` disj arm to a
CLOSED struct; (b) when the buried-self-ref guard fires for a DEFINITION, it now re-derives closedness
ORTHOGONALLY — the own struct-literals (flattened out of their `&`-grouping via `flattenConjMembers`,
self-ref dropped) are closed via the hoisted `closeDefLiteralUnion` and emitted ALONGSIDE the untouched
unexpanded ref, so the cycle→top VALUE rule is unchanged while closedness is restored. Both wild seeds
GREEN (`def-closedness-bare-disj-conj-arm`, `def-closedness-buried-selfref-conj`); `ClosednessTests`
`defflatten_baredisj_*` + `defflatten_buried_selfref_*` reject / select-admit / plain-and-flat-control /

cycle-value orthogonality verified (self-conj-cycle, direct/buried/mutual self-ref values unchanged). The
milestone "all soundness leaks closed" is re-reachable — the NEXT adversarial audit confirms.
~~OPEN — MILESTONE NOT substantiated.~~ The
`345f08b` normal-form fix closed the nested-`.conj` leak ONLY when the definition body was a `.conj`
(where `normalizeDefBodyConjunct` runs inside `flattenConjDefRef`'s `.conj`-body arm). Two
def-body shapes bypassed that arm and leaked a use-site extra past a parenthesized nested `.conj`:
- **(a) Bare-`.disj` def body.** `#X: ({b:2} & {d:4}) | {c:3}` · `#X & {z:9}` ⇒ kue emits
  `{y:{b:2,d:4,z:9}}` (exit 0); cue ⊥ (`z: field not allowed`). Same with the nested-`.conj` in the
  SECOND arm. When the def body IS a bare `.disj` (not `struct & disj`), `Field.value field` is
  `.disj`, matched by `flattenConjDefRef`'s `| _ => [constraint]` — it never enters the `.conj` arm,
  so the disj's nested-`.conj` arm is never merged and `disjArmClass (.conj _) = .blocking` still
  poisons distribution. The `345f08b` disj-arm fixture uses the WRAPPED form `{a:1} & ((…)|{c:3})`
  (which DOES enter the `.conj` arm), so it passes while the bare form leaks. Controls that already
  close: bare-`.disj` with PLAIN struct arms (`#X: {b:2} | {c:3}`) and the wrapped form.
- **(b) Buried-self-ref nested `.conj`.** `#X: {a:1} & (#X & {b:2})` · `#X & {z:9}` ⇒ kue emits
  `{y:{a:1,b:2,z:9}}`; cue ⊥. The def resolves to the closed `{a,b}` (verified `#X & {a:1,b:2}` ⇒
  ok), but the buried-self-ref guard returns the body UNEXPANDED (to avoid unrolling the self-ref),
  so the own-literal-union close never runs and closedness is dropped. The FLAT form
  `#X: {a:1} & #X & {b:2}` closes correctly (top-level self-ref → `expanding`/close-over-literals
  path).

**Root (shared):** closedness of a def body is recovered ONLY on the `.conj`-conjunct normalization /
cross-product-disj path; any def-body shape that reaches the closedness fold by a different exit
(bare-`.disj` body → `| _ => [constraint]`; buried-self-ref → unexpanded `[constraint]`) sees the
raw nested `.conj` and does not close it. **Fix direction:** apply the def-body normal form
(`normalizeDefBodyConjunct` / the merge of a pure-struct `.conj` disj arm) on the bare-`.disj`-body
path too — i.e. normalize a DEFINITION body regardless of whether its top constructor is `.conj` or
`.disj` — and re-derive the buried-self-ref case's closedness from its own struct literals without
unrolling the self-ref (the top-level-self-ref close path already does this; extend it to the buried
case). Red seeds committed `.known-red`: `testdata/wild/def-closedness-bare-disj-conj-arm/` and
`testdata/wild/def-closedness-buried-selfref-conj/`. Add `ClosednessTests` reject / select-admit /
flat-and-plain-disj control guards for both faces; graduate both seeds in the fixing slice. Broad
adversarial sweep otherwise CLEAN (closedness embed-def / def-unify-def / close() / comprehension /
optional / hidden / pattern-constraint corners; disj default+closedness, 3-deep; number precision,
struct-comp, scalar-embed, bounds chains, interpolation, bytes, big-int, div-by-zero, mod — all
match cue v0.16.1), so these two shapes are the SOLE remaining Phase-A residual.

**DEF-CLOSEDNESS-REREF-DROP (HIGH soundness — SILENT closedness leak / over-acceptance; 2026-07-13
Phase A MILESTONE-CONFIRMATION audit, 3rd attempt). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-13, DEF-BODY-CLOSEDNESS-UNIFY —
the SINGLE-FLOW-POINT structural fix that closes the entry-path leak CLASS by construction).** The
durable fix routes ALL def-body closedness through ONE point: `flattenConjDefRef`'s `defBodyConjuncts`
now dispatches by CLOSEDNESS PROVENANCE, not per-top-constructor patching. A struct-shaped body
(`.struct`/`.structComp`) SELF-CLOSES via standalone eval (its closedness is intrinsic), so it keeps
the standalone path; EVERY OTHER definition body — `.disj`, `.refId`, and any future indirection
(`.selector`/`.builtinCall`) — is INDIRECT/COMPOSITIONAL, its closedness flatten-DERIVED, so it
DEFAULTS to `some [body]` and flows through normalization + the recursive `flattenConjDefRef` flatten.
A bare `.refId` def body thus recurses into its referent's OWN flatten and carries the referent's
derived closedness — the `#X: #Y` leak. The `| _ => none` arm that silently dropped a non-`.conj`
def body's derived closedness — the recurring bug the three prior per-arm patches kept relocating — is
DELETED; a new indirection constructor cannot bypass normalization by construction (it hits the
routed default, the SOUND/closed-preserving side). `ClosednessTests` `defflatten_reref_*` (nested-conj
+ split-literal reject / multi-hop reject / disjbody reject / admit-own / single-struct control /
open-tail admit / non-def hidden-ref admit) pin per-entry-path completeness + both-direction guards;
seed `def-closedness-reref-drop` graduated; full `check.sh` green, zero L-series / Bug2 / closedness /
cycle-value flips (self-conj-cycle, direct/buried/mutual self-ref VALUES unchanged — closedness is
orthogonal to the cycle→top value rule). NOTE: this did NOT close
DEF-COMPREHENSION-CONJUNCT-USESITE-BOTTOM below (a comprehension-CONJUNCT `.conj` body — an
over-REJECTION, a different mechanism) — that landed SEPARATELY (✅ 2026-07-13, `mergeCompDefBody`).
~~OPEN — MILESTONE NOT substantiated.~~ The THIRD
def-body entry-path residual, same class the batch was closing. When a definition's closedness is
FLATTEN-DERIVED by `flattenConjDefRef` (nested-conj close, split-literal union close) rather than
intrinsic to a single struct literal, RE-REFERENCING that def through another def body that is a
bare `.refId` drops the derived closedness:
- `#Y: ({b:2} & {d:4})` · `#X: #Y` · `#X & {z:9}` ⇒ kue emits `{y:{b:2,d:4,z:9}}` (exit 0); cue ⊥
  (`y.z: field not allowed`). Also leaks the split-literal form `#Y: {b:2} & {d:4}`.
- Controls that already close (must STAY green): the DIRECT forms `#Y & {z:9}` (both nested-conj and
  split-literal reject); and the re-ref of a SINGLE-struct-literal def `#Y: {b:2,d:4}` · `#X: #Y`
  (closedness intrinsic to the struct, correctly rejects). So the leak is SPECIFIC to re-referencing
  a flatten-DERIVED-closed def.
**Root:** `#X`'s body is a bare `.refId #Y`, matched by `defBodyConjuncts`'s `| _ => none` →
`[constraint]` unexpanded; `#X` then resolves via plain ref-eval to `#Y`'s materialized VALUE, which
carries no flatten-derived closedness (the close ran only at `#Y`'s own flatten, not on the
re-referenced form). This is the recurring lesson made structural: `normalizeDefBodyConjunct` /
`closeDefLiteralUnion` are reached only for `.conj`/`.disj` def-body top constructors; a `.refId`
body is a THIRD entry that bypasses them. **`defBodyConjuncts` is per-arm, NOT a single complete
point** — a def-body `.refId` (and the pure-comprehension body below) enters closedness by a path the
normalization never sees. **Fix direction:** when a def body is a bare `.refId` to another
DEFINITION slot, propagate the referent's DERIVED closedness (flatten the referent through
`flattenConjDefRef` and carry its close), rather than emitting the unexpanded ref that materializes
open. Prefer designing-out the class: route ALL def-body closedness through one point that every
top constructor flows through, so a new body shape cannot bypass it. Red seed:
`testdata/wild/def-closedness-reref-drop/` (nested-conj + split-literal faces). Add `ClosednessTests`
reject guards for both faces + the single-struct-literal-reref and direct-form controls; graduate the
seed in the fixing slice.

**DEF-COMPREHENSION-CONJUNCT-USESITE-BOTTOM (HIGH — spurious over-rejection; 2026-07-13 Phase A
audit). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-13).** A DEFINITION whose body CONJOINS a comprehension embedding with a
struct literal bottomed on ANY use-site unification — even with an EMPTY struct, so it was NOT a
closedness/field-allowed effect: `#X: {for k, v in {p:1} {"\(k)": v}} & {b:2}` · `#X & {}` ⇒ kue ⊥;
cue admits `{b:2,p:1}`. **Root:** `flattenConjDefRef` SPLIT the comprehension `.structComp` from its
sibling struct literal into separate conjuncts; each self-closed via `closeDefBody` (comp → `close{p}`,
literal → `close{b}`), and the two disjoint closed structs mutually rejected each other's fields
(`close{p} & close{b}` ⊥). `ownLiteralUnion` unions a pure-LITERAL body before closing, but a
`.structComp` is not `isUnionableDefValue`, so the comprehension+literal shape had no joint-close path.
**Fix:** `mergeCompDefBody` (`Kue/EvalBase.lean`) — when a def `.conj` body has ≥1 real `.comprehension`
embedding AND every conjunct is a plain struct/structComp (no tail value, no pattern constraints),
NORMALIZE each conjunct (applying `closeDefBody` so `regularOpen`→`defClosed`) then MERGE into ONE
`.structComp` (fields union via `mergeFieldListWith joinUnevaluated`, comprehensions append, openness
unions). The single structComp closes over the JOINT field set AFTER the comprehension runs — the
standalone `.structComp` def-close path. Both-direction guards hold: resolution ADMITS (`& {}`, own
field, comp output, multi-field, empty-source, order-independent), closedness still REJECTS a genuine
extra (`& {z}`) and a conflict (`& {p:99}`, comp/literal overlap `b:1`/`b:2`); a `...`-tail keeps it
OPEN (`& {z}` admits). cue v0.16.1 truth table matches every case (no divergence). Controls stay green:
comprehension-ALONE def, non-def `X: {for…} & {b:2}`, pure-comprehension use-site field-add (`#X: {for…}`
· `#X & {b:2}` ⇒ both ⊥). Seed `testdata/wild/def-comprehension-conjunct-usesite-bottom/` graduated;
`ClosednessTests` `defcomp_conjunct_*`/`defcomp_alone_control_*` (14 theorems). Fell out of the
`defBodyConjuncts` `.conj` arm, NOT the DEF-BODY-CLOSEDNESS-UNIFY entry-path class.

**DISJ-CLOSEDNESS-EXCLUDED-ARM-LEAK (HIGH soundness — SILENT closedness leak; 2026-07-13 Phase A
audit `f0ddb19`). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-13).** `isDistributableDisj` (`Kue/EvalBase.lean`) was all-or-nothing
per disjunction: one non-whitelisted arm — a `.bound` (`>5`) or a list carrier (`[1,2]`) — made the WHOLE
disjunction non-distributable, so the def flattened OPEN and a use-site extra field leaked
(`#X: {a:1} & ({z:9} | >5)` · `#X & {w:7}` ⇒ kue `{a,z,w}`; same with `[1,2]`). Fix: `isDistributableDisjArm`
gains a DISTRIBUTE-SAFE category beside `.prim` — `.kind` (every `Kind` is scalar/list, never struct),
`.boundConstraint`, and the list carriers `.list`/`.listTail`/`.embeddedList`; each DIES against the def's
non-empty own struct literal, so its cross-product combination emits an OPEN `.conj [literal, pick]` that
bottoms at eval (identical to the working scalar path) while the struct arms close. `error(...)`/comprehension
arms stay OUT (force-fold / can-produce-a-struct) — bug214b untouched. Wild

> RESOLVED (2026-07-13, DISJ-CLOSEDNESS-DISTRIBUTE-STRUCTURAL): the DIRECT `error(...)` arm leak closed —
> DISJ-CLOSEDNESS-ERROR-ARM-LEAK ✅ LANDED (below).

**DISJ-CLOSEDNESS-DISTRIBUTE-STRUCTURAL (the durable CLASS fix; 2026-07-13). ✅ LANDED.** The hand-enumerated
`isDistributableDisjArm` whitelist MISSED the "bottoms-against-a-struct-literal" arm class TWICE. Replaced it
with a DERIVED predicate `disjArmClass : Value → DisjArmClass` (`Kue/EvalBase.lean`) — a COMPLETE match over
every `Value` constructor (no catch-all), so a NEW shape is a COMPILE error, not a silent leak. Four classes,
DERIVED from how the arm meets the def's non-empty own struct literal `{…}`:
- `fieldCarryingClosed` (struct / structComp) → union+close;
- `fieldCarryingOpen` (def-`.refId`) → compose OPEN, the ref governs closedness;
- `bottomsVsStruct` (scalar/kind/notPrim/regex/format/bound/uniqueItems/list-carriers/lengthConstraint/
  `error(…)`/`⊥`) → the arm carries NO new allowed field, so the literal closes around it;
- `blocking` (unevaluated expr of unknown result kind, `_`) → leave the disjunction raw.
**Emission reframe:** the `bottomsVsStruct` branch now CONJ's the pick against the CLOSED literal
(`closeLiteralUnion literals`), not the open literal — so a kind-mismatched pick (scalar/list/`error`) bottoms
the combination AND a *composes-closed* pick (`struct.MinFields`, `_`) rides the CLOSED literal and rejects
use-site extras. This closes both residuals below by construction. **Call-form validators**
(`list.MinItems(2)`, `struct.MinFields(2)`) reach the flatten level as UNLOWERED `.builtinCall`s (bare
validators like `=~`/`time.Duration` pre-resolve, call-forms don't): `disjArmClass` lowers a `.builtinCall`
through the existing `evalBuiltinCall` and classifies the validator — no hand-list of builtin names.

**DISJ-CLOSEDNESS-ERROR-ARM-LEAK (HIGH soundness — SILENT closedness leak). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-13,
DISJ-CLOSEDNESS-DISTRIBUTE-STRUCTURAL).** `#X: {a:1} & ({z:9} | error("x"))` · `#X & {w:7}` ⇒ was kue
**`{a,z,w}`** (leak), cue ⊥. **The bug214b tension DISSOLVED by layer separation, not force-fixed:** closedness
distribution fires ONLY for DEFINITION fields (`field.fieldClass.isDefinition` gates `close`); bug214b's
`structShape | error("nope")` lives under a REGULAR field (`close=false`), so the distribution NEVER touches it
and the disjunction still force-folds at normal eval. In the DEFINITION context the `error` arm is now
`bottomsVsStruct` (`{a:1} & error(…)` force-folds to ⊥), so the def closes `{a,z}` around it. cue surfaces the
error message `x` (the `{a,z}` arm bottoms on `w`, the `error` arm resurfaces as sole survivor); kue surfaces
`conflicting values (bottom)` (the closedness rejection) — result ⊥ agrees, only the diagnostic differs
(message-only, spec-irrelevant). Wild `def-closedness-disj-error-arm/` (RED→GREEN); `Bug2xTests`
`defflatten_errorarm_{rejects,select_admits}`; bug214b L-series untouched.

**DISJ-CLOSEDNESS-EXCLUDED-ARM-LEAK-2 (HIGH soundness — SILENT closedness leak). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-13,
DISJ-CLOSEDNESS-DISTRIBUTE-STRUCTURAL).** The four-plus residual arm shapes now close by construction via the
derived predicate: `.stringRegex`, `.stringFormat`, `.uniqueItems`, `.notPrim`, and `.lengthConstraint` (all
kinds). **CORRECTION to this entry's own earlier prescription (`k != .fields`):** the filing claimed `.fields`
(`struct.MinFields`) COMPOSES and MUST stay excluded / OPEN-composed. FALSIFIED by observation —
`#X: {a:1,b:2} & ({z:9} | struct.MinFields(2))` · `#X & {w:7}` ⇒ kue was `{a,z,w}` (leak), cue ⊥ (`w` not
allowed): a CLOSED definition rejects the extra REGARDLESS of the validator. So `.fields` IS `bottomsVsStruct`
— it composes-CLOSED (rides the closed literal, carrying no new field), and the closed-literal emission makes
it reject extras. No `.fields` special-case survives; the `.lengthConstraint` arm is uniform. `.top` likewise
folds in structurally (composes-closed to the closed literal) but stays `blocking` here — its bare-`#X`
disjunction resolution diverges from cue independently and is out of this slice's scope. Wild

**LIST-SORT-EMBEDDED-CARRIER (HIGH soundness — SILENT wrong value; 5th carrier-miss; NEW, 2026-07-13 Phase A
audit — the residual `f7f954f`'s re-sweep predicted). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-13).** `runSort` (`Kue/Eval.lean`)
matched ONLY `.list items`, so `.embeddedList`/`.listTail` operands DEFERRED ("incomplete value") instead of
sorting — the carrier-miss on the EFFECTFUL `EvalM` path (`evalListBuiltin`'s `openListOperand` never reached
it). Fix routes `runSort`'s evaluated `listValue` through `listItems?` (all three carriers present their
concrete prefix by construction), keeping the settled→bottom / abstract→defer fallback for a non-list operand;
`list.SortStable` shares `runSort`. `list.Sort({[3,1,2], _y:9}, list.Ascending)`, `SortStable(…)`, and open-tail
`list.Sort([3,1,2, ...int], …)` all ⇒ `[1,2,3]` (cue AGREES — prefix-sorts, no divergence). Wild

`SortTests` `eval_list_sort_embedded_list`/`eval_list_sort_stable_embedded_list`/`eval_list_sort_open_tail`.
**EvalM CARRIER SWEEP:** runSort is the SOLE list-CONSUMING builtin site on the effectful path (Sort/SortStable
share it; the effectful-builtin population is exactly these two). The other `.list`/`.listTail`/`.embeddedList`
matches in `Eval.lean` are list-literal EVALUATION and unification `meet` arms — carrier-preserving structural
code, not builtin list-reads. So the effectful path is now carrier-complete: NO 6th miss.

**LIST-UNIQUEITEMS-CALL-FORM-BOTTOM (HIGH soundness — SILENT wrong value; wild-caught during the Phase A
carrier re-sweep — PRE-EXISTING, NOT in the audited batch). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-13).** The `(list)` CALL form
was unrouted: only the `[]`-args validator form (`| "list.UniqueItems", [] => .uniqueItems`, `Kue/Builtin.lean`)
and the bare-reference form existed, so `list.UniqueItems([1,2,3])` fell to `unresolvedOrBottom` ⇒ ⊥ (cue
`true`). Fix adds a call-form arm `| "list.UniqueItems", [.list items] => .prim (.bool (!hasGroundDup items))`
beside the validator — deciding structural uniqueness via `hasGroundDup` (the SAME predicate the `.uniqueItems`
meet uses), over the `openListOperand`-normalized operand so embedded/open-tail lists descend. `([1,2,3])`⇒true,
`([1,1])`⇒false, embedded/open-tail⇒true (cue agrees). `([1,1.0])`⇒kue **false** / cue `true` — the established
STRUCT-EQ-LEAF-TYPESENSE value-based-equality divergence (logged, extended in `cue-divergences.md`). Wild

✅ LANDED (2026-07-13).** Carrier completeness now covers the slice desugar too — every list-carrier read
routes through `listItems?`, restoring the LIST-OPS-EMBEDDED-CARRIER invariant the Phase A retraction flagged.
The `slice` desugar of `x[lo:hi]` in `evalCoreBuiltin` (`Kue/Builtin.lean` ~1468) hand-enumerated `.list` +
`.listTail` and MISSED `.embeddedList` — `evalCoreBuiltin` does NOT map `openListOperand` over its args (only
`evalListBuiltin` did), so this dispatch was never migrated by the LIST-OPS-EMBEDDED-CARRIER slice. Repro:
`({[1,2,3], _y: 9})[0:2]` was kue **`incomplete value: slice(…)`** (deferred residual); `len`/index on the
same embeddedList already worked (routed through `listItems?`), slice was the lone outlier. Fix: collapsed the
two hand-enumerated arms into ONE routed through the classifier — `| "slice", [value, .prim (.int low), .prim
(.int high)] => match listItems? value with | some items => listSlice items low high | none =>
unresolvedOrBottom …` — so all three carriers descend by construction, NO 3rd hand-added arm. Non-concrete

**DISJ-NESTED-ERROR-ARM-AMBIGUOUS (LOW — divergent error, NOT a leak; NEW, 2026-07-13 Phase A audit).
OPEN.** `#X: {a:1} & ({b:2} | ({c:3} | _|_))` · `#X & {extra:9}` ⇒ kue **`ambiguous value: multiple
non-default disjuncts remain`**, cue ⊥ (`field not allowed` + explicit-error empty disjunction). A nested
disj arm containing an `error` arm is non-distributable, so the whole disj stays raw and eval reports
ambiguity instead of collapsing to bottom. Both are ERRORS — no field leaks, no soundness impact; purely a
divergent error path/message. Low priority.

**LIST-OPS-EMBEDDED-CARRIER (HIGH soundness — SILENT wrong value / bottom; NEW, 2026-07-13 Phase A audit).
✅ LANDED (2026-07-13 Phase B audit).** The three list carriers — `.list`/`.listTail`/`.embeddedList` —
all mean "a list"; `listConcat.collect`, `listFlattenFuel`, `listNestingDepth`, `lenValue`, and
`openListOperand` (`Kue/Builtin.lean`) hand-enumerated `.list`+`.listTail` and let `.embeddedList` (a
struct embedding a list plus non-regular decls, `{[1,2], _x: 9}`) fall through — a carrier-enumeration
asymmetry. **REFRAME (supersedes the filing's "add a `.embeddedList` arm to each" prescription):** the
fix routes EVERY list-carrier read through the single classifier `listItems?` (`Kue/Value.lean`), so a
missed carrier is designed out — one classifier, N consumers. `listConcat`/`listFlattenFuel`/`lenValue`/
`openListOperand` route through it directly (fuel/spine recursion, no termination cost). The prior filing
asserted the full-flatten depth site FORCES a direct `.list inner` pattern arm (structural-recursion
subterm) — falsified: `listNestingDepth` is DELETED, replaced by `listFlattenAll`, a WF recursion through
`listItems?` proven terminating by `sizeOf_listItems?_lt` (a carrier's element list is structurally
smaller than the carrier) + `List.sizeOf_lt_of_mem`. So even the structural site routes through the one
classifier. Two MORE carrier-miss sites found beyond the filing's three — `lenValue`
(`len({[1,2,3],_x:9})` ⇒ deferred, not `3`) and `openListOperand` (the single `list.*` operand normalizer
— missed `.embeddedList`, so EVERY `list.*` builtin failed on an embedded-list operand). Wild
`list-ops-embedded-sublist/` GRADUATED, expanded to six facets (concat/flatten1/depthFull + lenEmbed/
sumEmbed/reverseEmbed). Spec-adjudicated, cue v0.16.1 AGREES on all — no divergence. `check.sh` green.
> RETRACTION (2026-07-13 Phase A audit): "EVERY list-carrier read routes through `listItems?`" was
> INCOMPLETE — the `slice` desugar in `evalCoreBuiltin` was never migrated and still missed `.embeddedList`
> (LIST-SLICE-EMBEDDED-CARRIER, filed HIGH above). "N consumers" missed one. RESOLVED (2026-07-13,
> LIST-SLICE-EMBEDDED-CARRIER ✅ LANDED): the slice desugar now routes through `listItems?` too, so the
> invariant holds again across the value-level list surface.

**LIST-CONTAINS-OPENTAIL-EQ (HIGH soundness — SILENT wrong value; NEW, 2026-07-13 LIST-OPS-NESTED-OPENTAIL).
✅ LANDED (2026-07-13 LIST-ELEM-EQ).** `list.Contains` compared each element against the needle with raw
Lean `BEq`, which distinguishes `.listTail` from `.list`, so `list.Contains([[1,2,...]],[1,2])` ⇒ kue
**false**, cue **true** (deep + struct-nested too). Fixed by routing `listContains`, list `==`, struct `==`,
and `list.UniqueItems` dedup through ONE shared `structuralEq` (`Kue/Value.lean`): recursive open-tail
stripping via `listItems?` (a `.listTail`/`.embeddedList` element equals its concrete-prefix counterpart at
every depth, through structs), VALUE-BASED prim leaves (`primStructEq`, spec int→float conversion),
order-independent struct compare. Wild `list-contains-open-sublist` (RED→GREEN); `BuiltinTests`
`list_contains_open_tail_{element,needle,deep,prefix_mismatch}` + `_int_matches_float` + `_string_not_bytes`.

**LIST-ELEM-EQ-NUMERIC-STRICT — REJECTED (2026-07-13 LIST-ELEM-EQ). NOT a bug: kue was already
spec-correct.** The filing claimed `[1] == [1.0]` ⇒ kue **true** is wrong and cue's **false** is right. The
CUE spec is EXPLICIT the other way (Comparison operators: numeric `==` converts int→float; list/struct
equality is "recursively equal" reusing `==`), so `[1]==[1.0]` is spec **true** — cue's structural `false` is
the STRUCT-EQ-LEAF-TYPESENSE cue bug already adjudicated 2026-07-04 (`cue-divergences.md`). The unified
`structuralEq` therefore keeps prim leaves VALUE-BASED, NOT strict; the fix scope was open-tail stripping
only. Consistency (ONE equality) also extended value-based leaves to `list.Contains` and `list.UniqueItems`,
so `Contains([[1]],[1.0])` ⇒ true and `UniqueItems([1,1.0])` ⇒ bottom — spec-correct, cue-divergent (logged).

**DEF-FLATTEN-CLOSEDNESS-DISJ-REF (HIGH soundness — SILENT closedness leak; PRE-EXISTING).
✅ FULLY LANDED (2026-07-13).** Multiple-disjunction cross-product landed first; the ref/scalar-arm +
nested-disj residuals landed in the follow-up.
> RETRACTION (2026-07-13 Phase A audit): the "closes the LAST known HIGH silent soundness leak" /

The DEF-FLATTEN-CLOSEDNESS-DISJ fix closed a def's own-literal union across a SINGLE all-struct
disjunction; the cross-product slice extended the distribution to MULTIPLE closable disjunctions; the
residual slice extended it to ref/scalar arms (open-compose) and nested disjunctions (flatten-first).
- **multiple disjunctions + defaults ✅ FIXED.** `#X: {a:1} & (*{b:2}|{c:3}) & (*{d:4}|{e:5})` ·
  `y: #X & {f:6}` was kue `{a,b,d,f}` (leak), cue bottom. Fix: `disjArmCrossProduct` (`Kue/EvalBase.lean`)
  distributes the own-literal union across the cross-product of every closable disjunction conjunct,
  closing each of the four combinations (`{a,b,d}|{a,b,e}|{a,c,d}|{a,c,e}`); a combination is a default
  iff EVERY component arm is a default (product-of-defaults collapse → `{a,b,d}`). A single disjunction is
  the one-list cross-product (identity), so the parent's per-arm behavior is unchanged. Wild
  `def-flatten-closedness-disj-multidisj{,-select,-open}` (RED→GREEN + both-direction guards);
  `Bug2xTests` `defflatten_multidisj_{rejects,select_admits,default_collapses,opentail_admits}`.
- **multiple disjunctions + defaults ✅.** `#X: {a:1} & (*{b:2}|{c:3}) & (*{d:4}|{e:5})` · `y: #X & {f:6}`
  bottoms every combination. `disjArmCrossProduct` distributes across the cross-product; a combination is
  a default iff EVERY component arm is a default.
- **ref/scalar arm ✅ LANDED.** `#Base: {b:2}` · `#X: {a:1} & ({z:9} | #Base)` · `y: #X & {b:2, extra:7}`
  ⇒ bottom (was kue `{a,z,b,extra}` leak). NO per-arm eval-resolution was needed: a cross-product
  combination carrying a NON-struct pick (a `.refId`, a scalar) is emitted as an OPEN `.conj [own-literals,
  ...picks]`, UNCHANGED, so normal eval composes it — a CLOSED ref rejects a foreign literal field
  (`{a:1} & #Base{b}` ⇒ ⊥), an OPEN ref (`#Base{b, ...}`) admits it, a scalar dies against the struct
  literal. The own literal stays OPEN under the ref (independently closing it to `{a}` would wrongly reject
  a field the ref DOES allow, e.g. `#Base{a,q}` admits `q`). `isDistributableDisjArm` is a default-deny
  whitelist (struct / structComp / `.refId` / scalar / nested distributable disj) — an `error(...)`,
  comprehension, or bound arm is NOT distributed (leaves the disj unchanged in `rest`), preserving the
  L-series force-fold path (`bug214b_disj_arm_*`). Wild `def-flatten-closedness-disj-ref` (RED→GREEN);
  `Bug2xTests` `defflatten_refarm_{closed_rejects,select_admits,base_contains_admits,open_admits}`.
- **nested disjunction arm ✅ LANDED.** `#X: {a:1} & ({b:2} | ({c:3}|{e:5}))` · `y: #X & {g:9}` ⇒ bottom
  (was kue `ambiguous`). `flattenNestedDisjArms` splices a nested `.disj` arm's own arms into the flat
  arm-list before the cross-product close (disjunction is associative; a nested arm is `default` only when
  both outer and inner marks are `default`). Wild `def-flatten-closedness-disj-nested` (RED→GREEN);
  `Bug2xTests` `defflatten_nesteddisj_{rejects,select_admits}` + `defflatten_scalararm_rejects`.
Over-close guard (both directions): an OPEN ref arm (`#Base: {b:2, ...}`) STAYS open — `defflatten_refarm_open_admits`
pins `extra` admitted (a pre-existing ref-composition field-order divergence, values spec-correct, logged
`cue-divergences.md#REF-OPEN-COMPOSE-FIELD-ORDER`). `isClosableDisj` was retired (subsumed by
`isDistributableDisj`).

**LIST-OPS-NESTED-OPENTAIL (HIGH soundness — SILENT wrong value; NEW, 2026-07-13 Phase A audit). ✅ LANDED
(2026-07-13).** LIST-OPS-PROBE normalized open-tail list operands (`.listTail items _ → .list items`) only
at the TOP level (`evalListBuiltin` maps `openListOperand` over `rawArgs`), so `list.*` functions that
destructure NESTED lists as elements never normalized an open-tail SUBLIST — the same defect family the
slice claimed to close, one level down. Repros (vs cue v0.16.1):
- `list.Concat([[1,2,...],[3,4]])` ⇒ kue **bottom**; cue ⇒ `[1,2,3,4]`.
- `list.FlattenN([[1,2,...],[3]], 1)` ⇒ kue **`[[1,2],3]`** (SILENT WRONG — un-flattened open sublist);
  cue ⇒ `[1,2,3]`. `list.FlattenN(…, -1)` (full flatten) same defect.
Root cause: only `.list` was matched at the two DESTRUCTURE sites that read a nested sublist as a list
operand — `listConcat`'s `collect` and `listFlattenFuel` (plus `listNestingDepth`, which sizes the
full-flatten fuel). Fix (`Kue/Builtin.lean`): each gains a `.listTail inner _` arm mirroring `.list inner`
(a direct pattern-match, NOT an `openListOperand` wrapper — the exposed `inner` must be a pattern subterm
for Lean's structural-recursion termination). Per-function, NOT blanket: Reverse/Take/Drop/Repeat/Slice
treat a nested sublist OPAQUELY and the manifest already strips its `...` on export (verified kue==cue), so
they are untouched. Wild `list-fn-concat-open-sublist/` + `list-fn-flattenn-open-sublist/` (RED→GREEN);
`BuiltinTests` `list_builtins_normalize_nested_open_tail`. Spec-gap `open-list-value-ops` extended to nested
position (`cue-spec-gaps.md`); matches cue, NO divergence. NOTE: the LIST-OPS-PROBE claim "the rest measured
green" covered only FLAT operands — nested open-tail was untested.
**Scoped-out (filed): LIST-CONTAINS-OPENTAIL-EQ — ✅ LANDED (2026-07-13 LIST-ELEM-EQ; see the entry above).**
The open-tail bug is fixed via the unified `structuralEq`. RETRACTION: this filing's "keeps STRICT prim
equality (int ≠ float)" reading was WRONG — the CUE spec mandates VALUE-BASED recursive equality (int→float
conversion), so `Contains([[1]],[1.0])` is spec **true** and the entangled LIST-ELEM-EQ-NUMERIC-STRICT filing
was REJECTED (kue's `[1]==[1.0]` ⇒ true was already spec-correct). See the LANDED/REJECTED entries above and
STRUCT-EQ-LEAF-TYPESENSE in `cue-divergences.md`.

**BOUND-OPERAND-CLASSIFY (MEDIUM soundness). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-12); PA-BOUND-GROUND discharged.**
`ScalarOperandClass.defer` split into `.incomplete` (retain the residual `.unary`) vs `.nonScalar`
(`.list`/`.listTail`/`.embeddedList`/`.struct`). `evalBoundOp`/`evalRegexMatchOp`/`evalNumPos`/`evalNumNeg`
⊥ a `.nonScalar` operand where they previously fabricated a residual constraint; `evalNeOp` retains it
(identical to its `.incomplete` arm). `.top`/`.disj`/`.kind`/abstract-constraint values stay `.incomplete`
(cue RETAINS `<_`, `<(1|2)`). Wild guards `testdata/wild/bound-nonscalar-{list,struct}/`,
`neg-list-operand/`, `regex-list-operand/` (all RED→GREEN); `EvalOpsTests` pins list/struct/embeddedList
⇒ ⊥ across the four ops + `neOp`/top/disj retain guards (both-direction correctness), closing the
`eval_bound_op_non_ordered_operand_bottoms` `.bool`-only coverage gap. `=~5` micro-divergence (kue ⊥ vs
cue-retained, kue more spec-correct) logged in `cue-divergences.md`. Followed by **BOUND-ORDEREDPRIM
(LOW)** — the `OrderedPrim` bound-operand retype (Phase-B audit block below); still OPEN, does NOT subsume
this classifier fix.

**MANIFEST-FIELDCOUNT (HIGH audit fix). ✅ CLOSED (2026-07-11).** `kue export` failed ENTIRELY on
any struct with ≥99 top-level fields (`incomplete value`), on trivial plain-int input. Root cause
(by observation): `manifestFieldsWithFuel`/`manifestItemsWithFuel` (`Kue/Manifest.lean`) peeled one
`manifestFuel` unit per SIBLING, coupling the budget to field COUNT (field at index `i` manifested at
fuel `100-2-i` → `.incomplete` at `i=98`; 500-field failed identically at 98, so a constant bump is a
pure cliff-move). Fix: thread fuel UNCHANGED across siblings (mirrors `evalFieldRefsListWithFuel`);
only the value-descent spends fuel; WF termination via lexicographic `(fuel, phase, len)`. Fuel now
bounds DEPTH only. WF recursion broke `rfl`, so ~30 manifest tests migrated whole-surface to the
`(… == …) = true := by native_decide` BEq idiom. Wild fixtures `wide-struct-{export,nested,large}/`.
**Class note: any fuel walk decrementing per list ELEMENT (vs per depth) has this bug; manifest was
the last such site — eval was already correct.** Also folded in a LOW audit test-guard
(`eval_add_context_rounding_half_up_even_tie`, apd half-UP tie rule, prior coverage zero).

**STDLIB-FLOAT campaign (scoped float work). F0 ✅ + F4 (`+ - * /`) ✅ + F2 (IEEE kernel) ✅ LANDED
(2026-07-11 / 07-12).** Scoping ruling: CUE numbers are arbitrary-precision apd decimal, NOT float64 —
kue's `Decimal` already represents them exactly, so most "float" work is decimal-kernel wiring. The
EXCEPTION is the handful of builtins cue exposes AS float64 (`strconv.FormatFloat`/`ParseFloat`,
`Log1p`/`Expm1`, trig): F2 (LANDED) builds the separate IEEE `BinFloat` kernel those need. Roadmap:
- **F0 (the cheap win) ✅ LANDED 2026-07-11.** Wired the existing `decimalLnScaled`/`decimalExpScaled`
  kernels to `math.Log`/`Log2`/`Log10`/`Exp`/`Exp2` (34-sig apd, byte-identical to cue), shipped all
  11 `math` constants (`Pi`/`E`/`Phi`/`Sqrt2`/`SqrtE`/`SqrtPi`/`SqrtPhi`/`Ln2`/`Log2E`/`Ln10`/`Log10E`),
  and fixed a latent trailing-zero trim bug in the shared apd renderer (`renderTranscendentalScaled`
  replaces `collapseDecimalToValue`; `Pow(10,⅓)` was mis-pinned to a trimmed 33-digit value — corrected).
  Domain: `Log`/`Log2`/`Log10` of ≤0 → bottom (kue has no `Inf`/`NaN`). No new kernel, no IEEE. See
  `cue-spec-gaps.md` STDLIB-FLOAT-F0.
- **F1 (LOW) — `math.Log1p`/`math.Expm1`. ⛔ WALLED 2026-07-13 (blocked on F5 + a float64-arith layer).**
  cue exposes these as FLOAT64 (17-digit), NOT apd. Probe against cue v0.16.1: cue's output is Go's
  **FDLIBM** `math.Log1p`/`math.Expm1` byte-for-byte (verified on the probe set AND on inputs where
  FDLIBM diverges from the correctly-rounded value — cue tracks FDLIBM, e.g. `Log1p(57.77663217306205)`
  → `4.073744363892741`, not the correctly-rounded `…274`). FDLIBM is NOT correctly-rounded: over 18 002
  random in-domain inputs it differs from the round-to-nearest-f64 value on **749 (4.2%) Log1p / 1090
  (6.1%) Expm1** cases (1 ULP). Consequence: the only route the **F2 kernel composes cheaply** — compute
  `ln(1+x)`/`exp(x)−1` in high-precision apd, round to f64, shortest-render — yields the *correctly-rounded*
  result, byte-off from cue on those ~4–6%, with NO eval-time way to know which inputs agree; so no safe
  subset of transcendental values ships. F2's `BinFloat` gives correctly-rounded decimal→binary,
  shortest binary→decimal, and formatting — but NO float64 arithmetic primitive (add/sub/mul/div with
  round-half-even at 53 bits) and NO IEEE bit-word manipulation. Byte-parity therefore requires: (a) an
  exact float64-arithmetic layer over `BinFloat` (each op IEEE round-to-nearest-even), (b) **F5's**
  `Float64bits`/`Frombits` bit-word extraction/insertion (FDLIBM manipulates the raw hi/lo words +
  exponent inserts directly), (c) faithful Lean ports of FDLIBM `Log1p` (k-reduction + 7-term `Lg1..Lg7`
  poly) and `Expm1` (reduction + rational approx). A multi-slice campaign that **depends on F5 first** —
  no longer a "wire the kernel" slice. Exact/special cases (`Log1p(0)=0`, `Expm1(0)=0`) and domain errors
  (`Log1p(-1)`→`-Inf`, `Log1p(<-1)`→`NaN`, `Expm1`-overflow→`+Inf` — all cue-emit-Inf/NaN, kue bottoms,
  same class as F0) match cleanly but were NOT shipped alone: a builtin that returns a value for one input
  and defers the transcendental core is a hollow, misleading surface. Reorder: **F5 → F1**. Stays
  `unresolvedOrBottom` (bare bottom on concrete arg — not even an `unsupportedBuiltin` marker today).
- **F2 (MEDIUM) — the IEEE float64/32 kernel. ✅ LANDED 2026-07-12.** `Kue/Float.lean`: a `BinFloat`
  model (`(-1)^neg · mantissa · 2^binExp`, exact big-integer arithmetic, NO hardware `Float`),
  correctly-rounded decimal→binary (`decimalToFloat`, round-half-to-even, overflow→error /
  underflow→±0), Burger–Dybvig shortest-round-trip binary→decimal (`shortestDigits`), and
  exact-finite-decimal fixed-precision (`exactDigits`+`roundToSig`). Formatting matches Go's
  `strconv` verbs `e E f F g G` byte-for-byte (`fmtE`/`fmtF`/`fmtG`; the shortest-`'g'` switch uses
  `eprec = 6` — cue v0.16.1's linked Go, NOT the older `21`). `strconv.ParseFloat(s, {32,64})`
  (stores Go's shortest-`'e'` string = cue's `apd.SetFloat64` anchor, so `ParseFloat("100")` renders
  `1E+2`) + `strconv.FormatFloat(f, verb, prec, {32,64})` wired into the `.strconv` family. Both 32
  and 64 supported (parameterized `FloatFormat`). DEFERRED (filed): verbs `b`/`x`/`X` (hex/binary
  float) and bitSize ∉ {32,64} → `unsupportedBuiltin`; negative-zero render divergence (see
  cue-divergences.md). Validated: 343 kernel cases + 300 random CLI cases byte-identical to Go/cue.
  Fixture `testdata/export/strconv_float`; theorems `parsefloat_*`/`formatfloat_*` in
  `Kue/Tests/StrconvTests.lean`; rule in `cue-spec-gaps.md` STDLIB-FLOAT-F2.
- **F3 — transcendental trig** (`Sin`/`Cos`/`Tan`/…), **UNBLOCKED by F2** (cue computes them in
  float64; the `BinFloat` kernel + shortest render anchor are the missing piece).
- **F4 — apd result-exponent preservation in float arithmetic. ✅ `+ - * /` LANDED (`+ - *`
  2026-07-11; `/` 2026-07-12).** Arithmetic threads the apd `(coefficient, exponent)` form (`ApdForm` +
  `apdAdd`/`apdSub`/`apdMul` + `apdRoundToContext` + `apdCarrierText`, `Decimal.lean`) instead of
  formatting the normalized `DecimalValue`, so `+ - *` byte-match cue's GDA form: add/sub exponent =
  `min(e₁,e₂)`, multiply = `e₁+e₂`, both rounded half-up to the 34-digit apd context (`2e2 * 3 = 6e+2`,
  `1e1 + 1e1 = 2e+1`, `1.20 + 1.30 = 2.50`, `1e34 + 1 = 1.000…e+34`, `1e1 - 1e1 = 0e+1`). NO change to
  the `DecimalValue` core type (zero blast radius); the carrier `text` round-trips through `floatApdForm`.
  **DIVISION** (`apdDivide?`, `Decimal.lean`) closes the same way: an exact-terminating quotient renders
  the apd ideal form (`6e2 / 3 = 2.0e+2`, `1000000/8 = 1.250e+5`, `8/2 = 4.0`, `1e34/1 = 1e+34`), pinned
  to depend ONLY on the quotient value against `cue export --out json`; non-terminating / >34-digit
  quotients keep the unchanged 34-digit `divideDecimalRational?` renderer. Rule + derivation in
  `cue-spec-gaps.md` STDLIB-FLOAT-F4; see also `compat-assumptions.md` §Numeric literals / §Arithmetic
  expressions. Guarded by `testdata/wild/float-apd-division-exponent/`.
- **F5 — `FloatConv`/template-float / `math.Float64bits`-class bit-twiddling**, **UNBLOCKED by F2**
  (`text/template` T3 float-in-data can now render via `Kue/Float.lean`; `Float64bits` needs the
  `BinFloat`→bit-pattern extraction, a small addition to the kernel).

**BYTE-ESCAPE-STRICT (LOW, 2026-07-11). ✅ CLOSED (2026-07-11).** The single-quote byte-literal
escape decoder (`decodeByteEscape`, `Kue/Parse.lean`) was LENIENT — an unrecognized escape kept the
escaped char literally, and it accepted `\"` as a literal `"`. cue v0.16.1 is STRICT: `'a\"b'` errors
`unknown escape sequence` (escapable quote is context-sensitive — `\'` byte-only, `\"` string-only),
and unknown escapes error. Fixed to cue-strict parity: `decodeByteEscape` drops `\"`, adds explicit
`\/` (cue-compat leniency, mirror of the string path), gates `\u`/`\U` on `Nat.isValidChar`
(surrogate/out-of-range rejected); both callers (`parseQuotedByteBody`, `parseMultilineByteBody`)
raise a parse error on `none` instead of the lenient fallthrough. Byte-context `\(` now parse-errors
("interpolation in byte literals is not supported yet") in both single- and multiline forms rather
than emitting wrong bytes (the `byte-literal-interpolation` quarantined seed's kue-output updated;
still red pending byte interpolation). 18 new `native_decide` in `ParseTests.lean`
(`byte_escape_*`); `BytesTests` `lex_bytes_interp_*` flipped to the parse-error verdict.
spec-gap `STRING-ESCAPE-SET` byte-path row closed.

**STDLIB campaign (2026-07-10, from an alpha stdlib test-drive against `cue` v0.16.1).** Five
findings A–E, ranked — all LANDED (2026-07-10). A follow-on **STDLIB-F** (list-item separator
enforcement), surfaced by slice D's separator work, is queued below.

- **A — stdlib import ROUTING + error quality. ✅ LANDED (2026-07-10).** kue misrouted every
  non-whitelisted import (dot-free stdlib paths like `net` included; `strconv`/`struct`/`time`
  are now implemented) to the
  disk module loader, surfacing the misleading `no cue.mod/module.cue found` error. Fixed:
  `isStdlibImportPath` (`Kue/Value.lean`) classifies by first path element (dot-free ⇒ builtin
  layer, dotted-domain ⇒ external module); a recognized-but-unimplemented stdlib path now emits
  `unsupported builtin package "<path>": …`. External paths route to `resolveImportTarget`
  unchanged. Wild fixture `testdata/wild/stdlib-import-misrouted-to-disk-loader/`. Spec-gap +
  log recorded. Scope was ROUTING only — NOT the package function bodies (B/C).
- **B — `struct` builtin package (MEDIUM). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-10).** `struct.MinFields(n)` /
  `struct.MaxFields(n)` implemented as a validator that participates in `meet` [GENERALIZED
  2026-07-11 by STDLIB-VALIDATORS: `Value.fieldCountConstraint (bound : FieldCountBound) (limit)` is
  now `Value.lengthConstraint .fields (bound : CountBound) (limit)`, `finalizeFieldCountConj` is
  `finalizeLengthConj` — same behavior]. Counting semantics (pinned vs cue v0.16.1):
  only REGULAR fields count — optional (`x?`), required (`x!`), hidden (`_x`), definition (`#x`),
  and `let` all excluded (`FieldClass.countsAsField`). Meet resolves asymmetrically under the
  monotone-non-decreasing field count — satisfied `min` drops, violated `max` bottoms — retaining
  the undecided residual (unsatisfied `min` / open `max`) in a `.conj` beside the struct, which
  `manifest` (`finalizeFieldCountConj`) adjudicates at finalization so cross-conjunct field
  accretion (`{a:1} & MinFields(2) & {b:2}`) is spec-correct. Fixture
  `testdata/export/struct_field_count`; theorems `fieldcount_*` in `FixtureTests`. The package's
  OTHER members (if any) are out of scope for this slice.
  - **Follow-up (2026-07-10, Phase-A audit fix — FIELDCOUNT-DISJ):** the finalize pass reached a
    retained residual only at the TOP level, not one nested inside a disjunction arm — so a
    disjunction arm whose retained `min` is under-count (`MinFields(2) & ({a:1} | {a:1,b:2})`)
    survived liveness (it holds no present `.bottom`) and shadowed the valid arm as a spurious
    "ambiguous". Fixed by finalizing each disjunction arm at manifest (`finalizeDisjArm` in
    `Kue/Manifest.lean`, reusing `finalizeFieldCountConj`); manifest-only, so meet-time accretion
    is untouched. Wild fixture `testdata/wild/min-fields-disj-arm-underfill-pruned/`; theorems
    `fieldcount_disj_*` in `FixtureTests` (prune, max-prune, genuine-ambiguity, accretion-preserved,
    empty-arm, min&max). Closes audit finding #2 (no prior fieldcount×disjunction test).
- **C — `strconv` builtin package (MEDIUM). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-10).** Pure conversions in
  `Kue/Strconv.lean`, dispatched via a new `.strconv` `BuiltinFamily` arm. **Shipped** (exact vs
  cue v0.16.1, arbitrary-precision matching Kue's `Int`): `Atoi`, `FormatInt`, `FormatUint`
  (= `FormatInt` in cue), `ParseInt`, `ParseUint`, `FormatBool`, `ParseBool`. `ParseInt`/`ParseUint`
  cover base-0 prefix auto-detect (`0x`/`0b`/`0o`/leading-`0` octal), Go's underscore-separator
  rule (base 0 only), case-insensitive digits, and the `bitSize` range check (`0` = unbounded,
  `b>0` = signed `[-2^(b-1),2^(b-1)-1]` / unsigned `[0,2^b-1]`, `b<0` = empty). Errors are typed
  `BottomReason`s (`strconvSyntax`/`strconvRange`/`strconvInvalidBase`). **Deferred, real-but-not-computed**
  (explicit arms → `unsupportedBuiltin`, per B-1 2026-07-11): `FormatFloat`/`ParseFloat` (float
  shortest-round-trip is incompatible with the exact-decimal core), `Quote`/`Unquote`/`QuoteToASCII`
  (need Go's full Unicode `IsPrint` table). `Itoa` is NOT a cue function (`cannot call non-function`)
  so it has no arm and bottoms BARE via the catch-all, matching cue's verdict (B-1). **Divergence:**
  base restricted to Go's
  documented `2..36`; cue leaks `math/big`'s `2..62` — recorded in `cue-divergences.md`. Fixture
  `testdata/export/strconv_basic`; theorems in `Kue/Tests/StrconvTests.lean`. STDLIB-A wild fixture
  repointed `strconv`→`time` (retraction).
- **D — import-placement parse grammar. ✅ LANDED (2026-07-10).** Root cause was NOT
  import-specific: kue lacked CUE's statement separation entirely — the operator-precedence
  chain skipped full trivia (newlines included) when hunting a trailing binary operator, so a
  newline never terminated an expression and consecutive declarations with no comma were
  silently accepted (`x: 1\nimport "strings"`, `foo "bar"`, `a: 1 b: 2` all passed). Fixed by
  implementing CUE's newline-termination (implicit-comma) rule: `skipSameLineTrivia` for every
  trailing-operator lookahead (horizontal ws, stopping at newline/`//`),
  operator-at-line-END still continuing (the operand parse skips full trivia after the
  operator), plus `fieldSeparator` enforcement in `parseFieldsUntil` (a `,`/`;`/newline must sit
  between declarations, else `missing ',' in struct literal`). Late import is one instance.
  Wild fixture `testdata/wild/import-after-decl/`; parse theorems in `Kue/Tests/ParseTests.lean`
  (§ Import placement + field separators). Spec-gap + log recorded.
- **E — unused-import diagnosis MESSAGE (LOW). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-10).** Confirmed render-only,
  as predicted: the `declared ⇒ used` VERDICT already lands (2026-07-05) with `.importedNotUsed`
  carrying path+alias; only the CLI render collapsed it to the generic `conflicting values
  (bottom)`. `Manifest.manifestWithFuel` now routes a `.bottomWith` whose reasons carry
  `.importedNotUsed` (via `unusedImportReasons`) to a new `ManifestError.importedNotUsed
  [(path, alias?)]`, which `Runtime.formatManifestError` renders as cue's per-import
  `imported and not used: "<path>"` (`" as <alias>"` when aliased, one line each for multiple).
  Position is NOT emitted — the reason carries no source span. Wild fixtures
  `testdata/wild/{unused-import,unused-import-aliased,used-import-ok}/`; render theorems
  `*_render_message` in `ImportEnforcementTests` (via new `exportErrorMessage` helper). Spec-gap
  recorded.

- **F — list-item separator enforcement. LANDED (LIST-SEP, 2026-07-10).** Slice D added CUE's
  newline/comma statement separation to STRUCT literals (`parseFieldsUntil`'s `fieldSeparator`);
  F mirrors that discipline into `parseListItems` by REUSING the same `fieldSeparator` +
  `parseFieldTerminator` helpers (no parallel list-specific separator). After: same-line
  comma-less `[1 2]` ⇒ parse error `missing ',' in list literal` (matches cue); newline-elided
  `[1\n2]` ⇒ `[1, 2]` (spec-correct auto-comma — cue REJECTS this inside `[]` while accepting it
  for structs, a cue bug recorded in `cue-divergences.md`). Comma/trailing-comma/nested/ellipsis/
  empty forms unchanged. Wild `testdata/wild/list-same-line-no-comma`; `ParseTests` LIST-SEP block.

- **STDLIB-PATH — `path` builtin package. ✅ LANDED (2026-07-11).** Highest-usage unimplemented
  stdlib package (11 hits in real configs). Algorithms in `Kue/Path.lean`; dispatch via a new
  `.path` `BuiltinFamily` arm (`evalPathBuiltin` in `Builtin.lean`). OS-parameterized: the three
  string constants `path.Unix`/`Windows`/`Plan9` (`= "unix"`/`"windows"`/`"plan9"`, resolved as
  `stdlibPackageValue?` constants; there is NO `path.OS` field — the cue package exposes only the
  three). **Shipped fully for unix/plan9** (identical separator behavior): `Clean`, `Join`, `Split`,
  `Dir`, `Base`, `Ext`, `IsAbs`, `SplitList`, `Resolve`, `Rel`, `Match`, `ToSlash`, `FromSlash`,
  `VolumeName`. `Match` is a faithful total port of Go's `filepath.Match` glob (`*`/`?` non-`/`,
  `[^…]` classes, `\` escapes, `**` rejected, malformed ⇒ bottom). Each function honors cue's os-arg
  default (`unix`, except `VolumeName` ⇒ `windows`); `ToSlash`/`FromSlash`/`SplitList` have no
  default (os arg required). **Deferred:** a `windows` os argument routes to `unsupportedBuiltin`
  (`"unsupported builtin function \"path.X\""`) — faithful volume-name/UNC/backslash handling is a
  large, error-prone corner, deferred rather than shipped wrong; an invalid os string bottoms
  (cue's disjunction unification error). Spec-gap recorded (path is a non-core stdlib surface,
  cue-compat tiebreak). `Kue/Tests/PathTests.lean` (75 `native_decide` — every function, edges,
  os constants, plan9==unix, windows deferral, invalid os, bad-pattern, plus 3 end-to-end export).

- **STDLIB-TIME — `time` builtin package (SCOPED). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-11).** High-general-leverage
  in real CUE configs (durations, RFC3339 timestamps, validators). Algorithms in `Kue/Time.lean`
  (Go-duration lexer, calendar-aware RFC3339 validator); dispatch via a new `.time` `BuiltinFamily`
  arm (`evalTimeBuiltin`). Introduces `Value.stringFormat (fmt : StringFormat)` — a meet-participating
  string validator mirroring `stringRegex`: a ground non-conforming string bottoms, an ABSTRACT string
  RETAINS the validator (so `string & time.Duration()` stays incomplete — no abstract fabrication).
  **Shipped (exact-integer / string-structural only):** `ParseDuration` (→ int64 nanoseconds,
  overflow ⇒ bottom); the `Duration`/`Time` validators (bare, `()`, and boolean function forms);
  `Format` restricted to the `RFC3339`/`RFC3339Nano` layouts; all unit/layout/month/weekday CONSTANTS.
  RFC3339 validation is calendar-aware (leap-year days-in-month); the offset is range-checked
  (hour ≤ 24, minute ≤ 60, both inclusive), matching cue/Go's `time.Parse` (STDLIB-TIME Phase-A
  followup). **Deferred with `unsupportedBuiltin`** (need a date↔epoch calendar engine or Go's
  format machinery — the scope boundary): `Unix`, `Parse`, `FormatString`, `Split`, `FormatDuration`,
  and any non-RFC3339 custom `Format` layout; `time.Date` is a nonexistent leaf ⇒ bare bottom.
  Duration is deliberately int64-bounded (the Go `time.Duration` type contract, not a Kue-exactness
  choice). Spec-gap recorded (STDLIB-TIME, non-core stdlib surface, cue-compat tiebreak).
  `Kue/Tests/TimeTests.lean` (60+ `native_decide`) + `testdata/export/time_basic.cue`.

- **STDLIB-NET — `net` builtin package (SCOPED to the IP validator surface). ✅ LANDED
  (2026-07-11).** Common in infra CUE (IP/CIDR validation). EXTENDS the `time` `stringFormat`
  pattern — 11 new `StringFormat` variants (`netIP`/`netIPv4`/`netIPv6`/`netIPCIDR` + 7
  address-class predicates), **NO new `Value` constructor** (keeps parked-2B constructor
  pressure flat). Algorithms in `Kue/Net.lean` (a total, fuel-bounded `net/netip`
  `ParseAddr`/`ParsePrefix` port + the `Addr.Is*` classification, over `NetAddr = v4 | v6`);
  dispatch via a new `.net` `BuiltinFamily` arm (`evalNetBuiltin`). Meet-participating like
  `time` (ground non-conforming string bottoms, abstract `.kind .string` retains). **Shipped:**
  `IP`/`IPv4`/`IPv6`, `IPCIDR`, and the class predicates `LoopbackIP`/`MulticastIP`/
  `InterfaceLocalMulticastIP`/`LinkLocalMulticastIP`/`LinkLocalUnicastIP`/`GlobalUnicastIP`/
  `UnspecifiedIP` (bare validators, `()`, and boolean `(s)` function forms — invalid ⇒ `false`
  except `IPCIDR(s)` which bottoms); constants `IPv4len`/`IPv6len`. **Deferred with
  `unsupportedBuiltin`** (the scope boundary): `FQDN` (cue = full IDNA2008 via
  `golang.org/x/net/idna` — needs the idna engine, not a label predicate) and every function
  returning a struct/list/tuple (`SplitHostPort`/`JoinHostPort`, `ToIP4`/`ToIP16`, `ParseCIDR`,
  `ParseIP`, `AddIP`/`AddIPCIDR`, `InCIDR`, `CompareIP`); a nonexistent leaf (`net.Host`,
  `net.CIDR`) ⇒ bare bottom; byte-list validator args defer too. Verified byte-identical to cue
  v0.16.1 (280-case IP-class differential + full CIDR battery + byte-identical export). Spec-gap
  recorded (STDLIB-NET). `Kue/Tests/NetTests.lean` (80+ `native_decide`) +
  `testdata/export/net_basic.{cue,json}`.

- **STDLIB-TEXTTEMPLATE-T1 — `text/template` builtin package (minimal green core + escapers).
  ✅ LANDED (2026-07-11).** Used by real `#Template` filters (`template.Execute`). cue v0.16.1
  exposes EXACTLY three callable leaves — `Execute`/`HTMLEscape`/`JSEscape` (all → string); every
  other name is a non-function `_|_`. New leaf module `Kue/TextTemplate.lean` (`import Kue.Value`
  only): a total, fuel-bounded lexer + parse-tree + tree-walk evaluator over its own
  `TemplateData` tree (float UNREPRESENTABLE by construction), plus the two pure escapers. NO new
  `Value` shape — all three leaves return `.prim (.string …)`. `.textTemplate` `BuiltinFamily` arm
  (`evalTextTemplateBuiltin`); `Kue.manifestToTemplateData` bridges an already-manifested `Value`
  (key-sorting struct fields). **Shipped:** text passthrough, `{{.F}}`/`{{.A.B}}`/`{{.}}`,
  `{{if}}`/`{{range}}`(list/struct key-sorted/null)/`{{with}}` + `{{else}}`, `{{/* */}}`,
  `{{-`/`-}}` trim, Go-`fmt` scalar/`map[k:v …]`/`[a b c]` rendering, missing/null ⇒ `<no value>`
  (nested null ⇒ `<nil>`), both escapers' ASCII surface. **Deferred with `unsupportedBuiltin`**
  (the T2/T3/T4 roadmap below): any FLOAT in the data (⇒ T3, the `strconv.FormatFloat` kernel), all
  builtin FUNCS/pipelines/variables/`printf`/`define` (⇒ T2/T4), `JSEscape` of a non-ASCII string
  (`unicode.IsPrint` table, same wall as `strconv.Quote`); malformed template / field-on-scalar ⇒
  bottom, nonexistent leaf ⇒ bare bottom. Verified byte-identical to cue v0.16.1 (35-case
  differential incl. a real `Execute("Hello {{ .name }}", {name:"World"})`). Spec-gap
  recorded (STDLIB-TEXTTEMPLATE-T1). `Kue/Tests/TextTemplateTests.lean` (60+ `native_decide`) +
  `testdata/export/text_template_basic.{cue,json}`. **Remaining roadmap:** T2 = builtin FUNC +
  pipeline + variable layer (additive; parser already isolates them as `.unsupported`); T3 = float
  rendering, folded into the FLOAT campaign (`strconv.FormatFloat` shortest-round-trip kernel); T4 =
  `printf`/fmt-verbs + `{{define}}`/`{{template}}`/`{{block}}` (largest surface, lowest priority).
  Wild-caught OUT-OF-SCOPE bug queued: `testdata/wild/cue-unicode-escape-dropped/` (`.known-red`) —
  kue's cue-file string lexer drops the backslash on a `\uXXXX` escape; seed for a string-lexer slice.

**PATTERN-BOUND-OPERAND Phase-A code-quality audit (2026-07-12, batch `1710ac3..a8e37e2`, 3 slices:
PA-FLOAT-TEST-6 / CORE-CONFORMANCE-PROBE / PATTERN-BOUND-OPERAND).** Last-audit reconciliation:
PA-FLOAT-TEST-6 ✅-LANDED verified (`ef25e93`, +20 StrconvTests guards); five OPEN LOW remain
legitimately filed (PA-ESC-2, PA-SUB-4, PA-TT-5, PB-TESTORG-4, PB-RELEASE-3), none due this batch,
none re-ranked. Both PATTERN-BOUND red seeds GRADUATED — `.known-red` deleted in `a8e37e2`,
`testdata/wild/pattern-bound-{string,reference}-operand/` now live green fixtures with spec-adjudicated
oracles. **PATTERN-BOUND verdict: SOUND at the meet/order/format layer; ONE eval-layer soundness bug
(PA-BOUND-GROUND, MEDIUM) + one type-leverage finding.** Deep audit: `primOrdCompare?` is TOTAL and
correct — numbers by EXACT decimal (`decimalLtValues`, no float rounding), strings by code point
(`charsLt` on `Char.toNat`), bytes by `UInt8` order; returns `none` for cross-family and null/bool,
and EVERY caller (`admitsPrim?`/`meetBoundPrim`/`meetTwoBounds`/`rangeFeasible`/`tightenSameSide`/join
canonical-order/`boundSubsumesBound`) handles `none` as a conflict or a stable-order fallback, never a
fabricated ordering. The `number`-sentinel demotion is genuinely INERT: every site that reads a
string/bytes bound's `domain` (`boundKindLabel`, `boundAdmitsKind`, `meetKindWithBound`, `meetBoundPrim`)
matches on `bound` FIRST and never consults `domain` for a non-numeric operand; `meetTwoBounds` narrows
`.number.narrow .number = some .number` harmlessly. The ~30 untouched `.boundConstraint _ _ _` wildcard
sites were spot-checked — all are Bool/Option probes (`classifyScalarOperand`, `isBottom`-class) or
verbatim-reconstruct arms (`| .boundConstraint b k d => .boundConstraint b k d`), none a Value-PRODUCING
match with a numeric-only assumption. Dead code confirmed unreferenced (`parseBoundValue`, `minDecimal`,
`maxDecimal`, `formatBoundLimit`: zero grep hits). Two findings:

- **PA-BOUND-GROUND (MEDIUM, correctness/soundness — eval-layer, NOT low-risk → filed not fixed).**
  `evalBoundOp`/`evalRegexMatchOp` (`Kue/EvalOps.lean`) route a GROUND non-scalar operand (list/struct)
  through `classifyScalarOperand`, whose `.defer` bucket CONFLATES "genuinely incomplete (ref/binary/
  selector/comprehension)" with "ground but non-scalar (list/struct)". A ground list/struct is then
  wrongly DEFERRED to a residual `.unary` node that FORMATS and EXPORTS as a fabricated constraint,
  where CUE hard-errors. Concrete repros (kue vs cue v0.16.1):
  `x: <[1,2]` → kue `x: <[1, 2]`, cue `cannot use list for bound <`;
  `x: <{a:1}` → kue `x: <{a: 1}`, cue `cannot use struct for bound <`;
  `x: =~[1]` → kue `x: =~[1]`, cue `cannot use list for bound =~`.
  Regression: pre-slice `parseBoundValue` made `<[1,2]` a PARSE ERROR (rejection); this slice turned a
  rejection into a fabricated non-⊥ output. Root cause is the shared classifier — the SAME conflation
  already mis-handles `x: -[1,2]` (kue `-[1, 2]`, cue `invalid operation - list`), so `evalNumPos`/
  `evalNumNeg` carry the pre-existing bug and this slice EXTENDED its surface to bound/regex lowering.
  Fix (type-leverage): split `ScalarOperandClass.defer` into `.ground` (resolved non-scalar → each op
  decides: bound/neg/pos/regex on list/struct ⇒ ⊥ per CUE, `!=` on list stays a legit `notPrim`) vs
  `.incomplete` (unresolved → defer), fixing all five ops at once. `!=[1,2]` correctly stays valid in
  BOTH (cue keeps `!=[1, 2]`; the `.ground` arm for `neOp` must still lower to `notPrim`). Spec basis:
  CUE grammar `rel_op UnaryExpr` requires the operand resolve to an ORDERED scalar (number/string/bytes)
  for `< <= > >=` and a string for `=~`; a ground non-scalar is a type error, not an incomplete. Adjudge
  the `=~5` micro-divergence too (kue ⊥ vs cue `=~5`): kue is MORE spec-correct — `=~` operand must be a
  string — record in `cue-divergences.md`. TDD: wild fixtures `testdata/wild/bound-ground-nonscalar-{list,
  struct}/` (red first), + EvalOpsTests theorems pinning `.list`/`.struct` operand ⇒ ⊥ (the current
  `eval_bound_op_non_ordered_operand_bottoms` tests only `.bool`, MISSING list/struct — the coverage gap
  that masked this).
  → **DESIGNED as `BOUND-OPERAND-CLASSIFY` in the Phase-B block below** (2026-07-12). The `.ground` name
  is CORRECTED to `.nonScalar`: cue-adjudication showed `<_` (top), `<(1|2)` (disj), `<(>5)` (bound
  operand) are all RETAINED by cue, so those ground-ish forms must stay `.incomplete`, not error. Only
  list/struct/embeddedList error ("cannot use X for bound"). See the block for the confirmed operand table.
- **PA-BOUND-DOMAIN-TYPE (LOW, illegal-states — Phase-B type-tightening candidate).** `boundConstraint
  (bound : Prim) (kind : BoundKind) (domain : NumberDomain)` admits two representable-nonsense states:
  (a) a null/bool operand (`bound : Prim` is too wide — a bound is only ever over an ordered type), and
  (b) a string/bytes bound carrying a numeric `domain` (the inert `.number` sentinel). Both are handled
  defensively at runtime (null/bool ⇒ conflict everywhere; sentinel proven inert above), i.e. exactly
  the "loose type guarded by runtime checks" the repo exists to erase. Propose a dedicated `OrderedPrim`
  sum — `num (v : DecimalValue) (domain : NumberDomain) | str String | bytes ByteArray` — so a bound
  over null/bool and a string-bound-with-numeric-domain become UNREPRESENTABLE and the `boundKindLabel`/
  `boundAdmitsKind` `.null | .bool => ...` dead arms vanish. Reversible, gate-arbitrated; a clean Phase-B
  slice. (Also folds `evalBoundOp`'s `.null`/`.bool ⇒ .bottom` into construction-time impossibility.)
  → **DESIGNED as `BOUND-ORDEREDPRIM` in the Phase-B block below** (2026-07-12); does NOT subsume the
  classifier fix — see the coherence note in that block.

**PATTERN-BOUND-OPERAND Phase-B architecture/refactor/cleanup audit (2026-07-12, whole module graph;
follows the Phase-A block directly above).** Reconciliation: PATTERN-BOUND red seeds verified graduated
(both `testdata/wild/pattern-bound-{string,reference}-operand/` live green, no `.known-red`). Five OPEN
LOW re-checked against HEAD — PA-ESC-2, PA-SUB-4, PA-TT-5, PB-TESTORG-4, PB-RELEASE-3 all still unlanded,
still correctly ranked, none re-ranked by this batch, no duplication with the two slices below.
Dead-code recheck: `parseBoundValue`/`minDecimal`/`maxDecimal`/`formatBoundLimit` are GONE from the tree
(zero grep hits) — already removed, nothing to excise. **Module-graph verdict: HEALTHY.** Float (F2) +
StringFormat leaves sit right (SOUND per the same-day F2 Phase-A + PB-SF-3; `Time`/`Net` independent
siblings, no `Time → Net`); no oversized core module (`EvalBase` 2530 / `Parse` 2369 / `Lattice` 1718 are
in-band; `CaseTable` 2438 is the generated Unicode table, exempt); test modules under the 1800 cap except
the mechanical `FixturePorts.lean` (registration, exempt) — `BuiltinTests`/`TwoPassTests` tracked by
PB-TESTORG-4. **The coupled bound-operand core-type findings (PA-BOUND-GROUND + PA-BOUND-DOMAIN-TYPE) are
designed here as ONE coherent fix, split into TWO ranked slices — soundness first, representation second
— because the MEDIUM soundness fix is small and independent while the representation tightening is a
~60-site refactor; coupling would delay the soundness fix behind a large blast radius.**

- **BOUND-OPERAND-CLASSIFY (MEDIUM soundness — the designed PA-BOUND-GROUND fix). ✅ LANDED
  (2026-07-12); implemented exactly as designed below.** Split `ScalarOperandClass.defer` into `.incomplete` (unreduced expression /
  cue-retained abstract value → keep the residual `.unary`) and **`.nonScalar`** (a fully-resolved
  list/struct value → categorically not an ordered scalar). **`.nonScalar` bucket (cue-confirmed
  "cannot use X for bound / invalid operation OP X"):** `.list`, `.listTail`, `.embeddedList`, `.struct`.
  **Everything else stays `.incomplete`** — INCLUDING `.top`, `.disj`, `.kind`, and the abstract-constraint
  values (`.boundConstraint`/`.notPrim`/`.stringRegex`/`.stringFormat`/`.lengthConstraint`/`.uniqueItems`/
  `.conj`), plus `.embeddedScalar` (wraps a scalar — may resolve to it; erroring would be wrong). This
  corrects Phase A's `.ground` name: cue-adjudication (2026-07-12) confirmed cue RETAINS `<_`, `<(1|2)`,
  `<(>5)` (so top/disj/bound-operand are NOT errors), while `<int`/`<number` error with a DIFFERENT class
  ("bound has fixed non-concrete value") — that non-concrete-`.kind` divergence is a SEPARATE latent case,
  NOT folded in here (kept `.incomplete`; file as its own follow-up divergence if pursued). **Per-op
  `.nonScalar` behavior:** `evalBoundOp`/`evalRegexMatchOp`/`evalNumPos`/`evalNumNeg` ⇒ ⊥ (the four ops the
  bug spans); **`evalNeOp` ⇒ retain `.unary .neOp value`** (identical to its `.incomplete` arm — cue keeps
  `!=[1,2]`/`!={a:1}`, both confirmed). So `.nonScalar` diverges from `.incomplete` ONLY in the four
  scalar-arith/bound/regex ops; `neOp` treats them the same. The other `classifyScalarOperand` consumers
  (`evalBoolNot`/`evalPrimitiveOrdering`/`evalBoolBinary`/binary `evalRegexMatch`) absorb `.nonScalar`
  into their existing deferred/retain arm — behavior preserved; the binary-comparison latent case
  (`1 < [1,2]` retains, cue errors) was a FLAGGED sibling follow-up — **DISCHARGED as BINARY-CMP-OPERAND
  ✅ LANDED (2026-07-12), see below.**
  Spec basis: CUE grammar `rel_op UnaryExpr` requires the operand resolve to an ordered scalar
  (number/string/bytes) for `< <= > >=` and a string for `=~`; a resolved list/struct is a type error, not
  an incomplete. Also record the `=~5` micro-divergence (kue ⊥ vs cue `=~5`, kue MORE spec-correct) in
  `cue-divergences.md`. **TDD:** wild fixtures `testdata/wild/bound-nonscalar-{list,struct}/` +
  `testdata/wild/neg-list-operand/` (the `-[1,2]` twin) + `testdata/wild/regex-list-operand/`, all RED
  first; EvalOpsTests theorems pinning `.list`/`.struct`/`.embeddedList` operand ⇒ ⊥ for
  boundOp/regexMatchOp/numPos/numNeg AND a `neq_list_operand_retains` pin that `!=[1,2]` stays a residual —
  closing the coverage gap where `eval_bound_op_non_ordered_operand_bottoms` tests only `.bool`. Small
  (one classifier + four op arms), test-first, independent of `OrderedPrim` below.

- **BINARY-CMP-OPERAND (MEDIUM soundness — the BOUND-OPERAND-CLASSIFY sibling). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-12).**
  `evalPrimitiveOrdering`'s retain-everything catch-all (`| _, _ => .binary op left right`) accepted a
  ground non-scalar operand in an ordered comparison as incomplete (`1 < [1,2]`, `{a:1} > 3` retained)
  where cue v0.16.1 hard-errors. Fix: split the catch-all into `.incomplete, _`/`_, .incomplete => .binary`
  (abstract-wins retain) BEFORE `.nonScalar, _`/`_, .nonScalar => .bottom` (both-ground non-ordered ⊥) —
  ⊥ fires only when BOTH operands are decided and one is non-ordered; abstract on either side retains
  (cue-confirmed: `[1,2] < a`, a abstract, is KEPT). **Matrix measured vs cue v0.16.1:** every cross-family
  GROUND ordered pair ⊥s (number/string/bytes × any incomparable, and same-type bool/null/list/struct);
  ordered-comparable ground pairs compute; abstract operands (ref-to-kind, or non-scalar vs abstract)
  retain. EQUALITY (`==`/`!=`) verified SEPARATELY and left untouched — total across types (`1 == [1,2]` ⇒
  false, `1 != [1,2]` ⇒ true), the ordered ⊥ must not leak into it. Wild fixtures
  `testdata/wild/binary-cmp-{list,struct}-operand/` (RED→GREEN); 7 EvalOpsTests theorems (⊥ + both-direction
  retain guards + 2 equality guards).

- **BINARY-CMP-BYTES (LOW correctness — bytes ordered comparison; kue BUG). ✅ LANDED** (`3fd6616`).
  `'a' < 'b'` ⇒ cue `true`, kue was `_|_`: `evalPrimitiveOrdering` threaded only `decimalOp`+`stringOp`,
  so a bytes×bytes pair found no compare fn and fell to ⊥. Spec makes `bytes` an ordered type
  (`< <= > >=` over number/string/bytes). Fix took the cleaner route than the filed `bytesOp` param:
  `evalPrimitiveOrdering` now routes the prim×prim case through `primOrdCompare?` (the single
  ordered-comparison primitive, already handling number/string/bytes) and reads its `Ordering` with the
  op's reader (`Ordering.isLT`/`isLE`/`isGT`/`isGE`). Bytes flow through for free; number/string paths
  are provably identical (`primOrdCompare?` uses the same `decimalLtValues`/`charsLt` the old lambdas
  did); the dead `stringsLt` helper dropped. Cross-type pairs (bytes-vs-string/number) still ⇒ `none`
  ⇒ ⊥ — the BINARY-CMP-OPERAND guard holds. Wild fixture `testdata/wild/binary-cmp-bytes/` + 21 unit
  theorems (both directions, inclusive `<=`/`>=`, byte-value order, multi-byte lexical, empty bytes,
  cross-type ⊥ both ways, equality-unaffected). **The last active wrong-value bug — CLOSED.**

- **BOUND-ORDEREDPRIM ✅ LANDED (2026-07-13).** Illegal bound-operand states now
  unrepresentable; **PA-BOUND-DOMAIN-TYPE discharged**. `boundConstraint (bound : OrderedPrim)
  (kind : BoundKind)` — `OrderedPrim` is the ordered subset of `Prim` (int/float/string/bytes)
  with `NumberDomain` folded into the numeric arms only, so a `null`/`bool` operand and a
  domain-bearing string/bytes bound are both structurally impossible. `OrderedPrim.ofPrim?`
  (null/bool → `none`) is the single trust boundary; the subsumed runtime guards
  (`boundKindLabel`/`boundAdmitsKind` null/bool arms, the `number` sentinel, the eval/parse
  null/bool→⊥ arms) are DELETED. Shipped as a 4-arm mirror (not the 3-arm sketch below) because
  `formatBoundOperand`'s int-vs-float render is observable — see implementation-log. Behavior-
  preserving: whole suite green, zero flipped theorems; 4 new unrepresentability theorems in
  `BoundTests.lean`. Original design sketch retained below for reference.

  Retype the bound operand: `inductive OrderedPrim | number (value :
  DecimalValue) (text : String) (domain : NumberDomain) | string (value : String) | bytes (value :
  Array UInt8)`, with `boundConstraint (bound : OrderedPrim) (kind : BoundKind)` — the domain FOLDS INTO
  the `number` arm, so string/bytes bounds carry no domain and the inert `.number` sentinel + "string
  operand + numeric domain" become UNREPRESENTABLE. `evalBoundOp` gains a total
  `OrderedPrim.ofPrim? : Prim → Option OrderedPrim` (none for null/bool ⇒ ⊥), which SUBSUMES the current
  `.null`/`.bool ⇒ .bottom` arms and erases the dead `.null | .bool` arms in `boundKindLabel`/
  `boundAdmitsKind`. **Coherence with BOUND-OPERAND-CLASSIFY — the subsumption is PARTIAL, one direction
  only:** `OrderedPrim` is the OUTPUT type of a *successful* lowering; the classifier decides on the INPUT
  `Value`. A list/struct never reaches `OrderedPrim` construction — it ⊥s at the `.nonScalar` arm first —
  so `OrderedPrim` does NOT erase the classifier's list/struct case; it complements it (tight output ⟂
  correct input dispatch). It DOES subsume the prim-level null/bool rejection. Blast radius: ~60 sites
  (`Lattice.lean` 40, `EvalBase.lean` 20, + `Value`/`Order`/`Format`/`Manifest`/`Resolve`/`Parse`) that
  construct or destructure `boundConstraint` — every `.boundConstraint bound kind domain` pattern rewrites
  to the two-field form; the number-vs-string/bytes split moves from `match bound with .int|.float ...` to
  a match on the `OrderedPrim` constructor. Reversible-by-git, gate-arbitrated, no fork — a mechanical but
  wide type-tightening slice; schedule after the soundness fix so it doesn't gate it.

**STDLIB-FLOAT-F2 Phase-A code-quality audit (2026-07-12, batch `a366a3a..a9fa4c6`, 3 slices:
EvalTests split / StringFormat leaf / IEEE float kernel).** Last-audit reconciliation: all five
✅-LANDED filings verified against commits — PA-NET-1 + PA-SF-3/PB-SF-3 + PB-DOCGRAPH-2 in
`4df164c`, PB-TESTORG-1 in `fb50312` (231 theorems conserved EXACTLY: 65+62+76+28, verbatim move
confirmed). Five OPEN LOW remain legitimately filed, none due this batch, none re-ranked:
PA-ESC-2, PA-SUB-4, PA-TT-5, PB-TESTORG-4, PB-RELEASE-3. **F2 verdict: SOUND.** Deep-audited the
subtle kernel and could NOT construct a counterexample: `decimalRatioToFloat` is correctly-rounded
round-half-to-even incl. the overflow round-to-inf tie (`m₀==hi`→bump→`e'>maxExp`→overflow, ties-to-
even lands on inf) and the subnormal boundary (`e==minExp` forces the SYMMETRIC B–D interval, so the
smallest-normal/subnormal margins are right); `roundToSig` rounds the EXACT finite decimal
(`exactDigits` = `m·5^(-binExp)`), matching Go; `genDigits` even/odd interval closure + carry-trim is
textbook B–D (the `1e23` upper-margin trap is pinned by fixture+theorem against cue); negative-zero is
ONE policy normalized at the number boundary (ParseFloat via `mkFloatText`, FormatFloat input pre-
normalized by kue's apd form) — consistent, documented divergence. No `partial def`; every catch-all
(`| _ => none`) is over a `Char` verb / kernel `Option`/`FloatParse`, never a `Value`-producing match.
Fixture `testdata/export/strconv_float.{cue,json}` re-verified a REAL cue oracle (byte-matches `cue
export`), auto-enforced by `check-export-fixtures`. One NEW finding:

- **PA-FLOAT-TEST-6 (LOW→MEDIUM, test-strength). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-12).** The three hardest F2
  boundaries — ephemeral in the out-of-tree 343-case Go battery, missing from the committed net — are now
  permanent guards: +20 `native_decide` theorems in `StrconvTests` (kernel-direct on `decimalRatioToFloat`/
  `decimalToFloat`/`roundToSig` to localize a regression, plus end-to-end `call` against the cue oracle).
  Each expected value adjudicated against Go `strconv` AND cue v0.16.1; **no boundary revealed a kernel
  bug** (all GREEN first try). (a) float64 overflow half-even MIDPOINT `(2^54−1)·2^970` ties-to-even ONTO
  inf, `−1` stays maxfloat (kernel + cue `ParseFloat` range/`1.797…E+308`); (b) float32 overflow tie
  `(2^25−1)·2^103` → inf, `1e39`/`3.5e38`→`+Inf`, `-1e39`→`-Inf`; (c) fixed-precision carry-growth
  `99.995`→"100.00", `0.9995`→"1.00", `999.5`→"1000", with `9.995`→"9.99" pinning that the nearest double
  (9.9949…, BELOW 9.995) does NOT carry (Go rounds the EXACT value). Also pinned largest-finite `'e'`
  render. The permanent guard now pins the hard boundaries — the ephemeral 343-case battery is fully
  superseded for these edges.

**STDLIB campaign Phase-A code-quality audit (2026-07-12, batch `f5b1537..69453ca`, 10 slices:
Time/Net/TextTemplate/escape-set/byte-escape/Float-F0/F4/F4-div/manifest-fieldcount).** A4
reconciliation: all previously-deferred items remain legitimately deferred with recorded basis —
B-3 DROPPED (moot), B-4 (strings test-org) and 2B (validator sum-type) coupled to a future
test-org / 3rd-validator trigger, `list.IsSorted` blocked on the BI-EFF comparator seam, strconv
`Quote`/`FormatFloat` blocked on the float64-shortest-round-trip wall (all `unsupportedBuiltin`,
never faked). Nothing to re-rank. Batch verdict: HIGH quality — `.stringFormat` is a closed sum
threaded through EVERY `.stringRegex` match site (meet, disjoin, subsume, format, manifest, hash,
resolve) with zero catch-all swallow; zero new `partial def` (all totality via fuel/structural,
compiler-verified via `termination_by`); documented cue-divergences (exact-int duration frac,
decimal Sqrt). Five findings, none inline-fixable low-risk (all touch core parse/type or are
Phase-B placement), all filed:
- **PA-NET-1 (MEDIUM, illegal-states). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-12, STRINGFORMAT-LEAF).** `NetAddr.v6`
  now carries `Vector UInt8 16` — the 16-byte width is in the type, so every classifier indexes
  with `bs[i]` (literal < 16, auto-total) and the `bs.getD i 0` value-fallbacks are gone. Smart
  constructor `mkNetAddrV6?` is the single trust boundary refining `finalizeIPv6`'s list into the
  fixed-width vector; the `v4` carrier was already tight (4 fields), untouched. Invariant pinned by
  `v6_width_by_construction`/`mkV6_*` theorems in `NetTests`.
- **PA-ESC-2 (LOW, DRY).** `decodeStringEscape` and `decodeByteEscape` (`Kue/Parse.lean`)
  duplicate the shared simple-escape core (`\a\b\f\n\r\t\v\\\/` + `\u`/`\U` codepoint). Extract a
  shared `simpleEscapeCodepoint? : Char → Option Nat` both consume (byte via raw byte /
  `codepointBytes`, string via `Char.ofNat`); keep the context-specific arms separate (`\x`/`\NNN`/`\'`
  byte-only, `\"` string-only). Core-parse edit → file, TDD.
- **PA-SF-3 (LOW, arch — Phase-B candidate). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-12, STRINGFORMAT-LEAF; see PB-SF-3).**
  `stringFormatValid` moved to its own `Kue/StringFormat.lean` leaf importing `Time` + `Net` as
  siblings; the `Time → Net` edge is erased. Landed jointly with PA-NET-1.
- **PA-SUB-4 (LOW, precision — sound).** `Kue/Order.lean` stringFormat subsumption is
  equality-only (`expectedFmt == actualFmt`), so `net.IP()` does not subsume `net.IPv4()`/`net.IPv6()`
  and the address-class hierarchy is flat. Sound (conservative false-negative, mirrors the
  `stringRegex` structural-equality arm), but imprecise: a class-hierarchy subsumption would
  tighten `net.IPv4() ⊑ net.IP()`. Note-grade.
- **PA-TT-5 (LOW, fuel-sufficiency — sound).** `TextTemplate.runTemplate` fuel
  `(nodeCount+1)(ds+1)²+ds+16` is quadratic in data size; nested `{{range}}` expands
  multiplicatively, so a pathological depth-≥3 nested-range template could exhaust fuel and
  spuriously `.bottom`. Fails CLOSED (never a wrong value) and T1 scope, but the bound is not
  proven sufficient for nesting depth. If a real nested-range template ever bottoms, capture a
  `wild/` fixture and lift the bound to `nodeCount · ds^depth`.

**STDLIB campaign Phase-B architecture/refactor/cleanup + INFRASTRUCTURE audit (2026-07-12, whole
module graph + gates/tooling).** Infra-rotation cycle (~4 audit cycles since the 2026-07-04 gate
rotation). Reconciled with Phase A's 5 findings — no duplication; PA-SF-3 REINFORCED below with the
concrete import edge. **Infra verdict: gates SOUND, no silent rot.** `check.sh` glob-discovers every
`check-*.sh`; the four `.lean` gates (`check-{ocifetch,zip,mod-tidy,fetch-pipeline}.lean`) are driven
by `check-fixtures.sh` via `lake env lean --run` (not orphaned); `check-ghcr-live.lean` is
deliberately unwired (live network, human-gated). Every cheap grep still matches its target
(`check-comments` denylist idioms, `check-test-health` `^theorem `/`#check @` tripwire — verified no
test module escapes via `private theorem`/`@[…]`, block-comment `^[[:space:]]*/-`); wild
auto-discovery + `.known-red` three-state quarantine (`handle_known_red`) intact. Findings:

- **PB-SF-3 (LOW→MEDIUM arch, REINFORCES PA-SF-3). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-12, STRINGFORMAT-LEAF).**
  `stringFormatValid` extracted into `Kue/StringFormat.lean` — a leaf importing `Time` + `Net` as
  siblings; `Lattice.lean:66` and `Order.lean:238` now `import Kue.StringFormat` (was `Kue.Time`).
  `Time.lean` imports only `Value` again — the `Time → Net` edge is gone, `Time`/`Net` are
  independent sibling leaves. Bundled with PA-NET-1's `Net` retype. Graph docs updated below +
  in `architecture.md` §5 (PB-DOCGRAPH-2 remainder discharged here).

- **PB-TESTORG-1 (MEDIUM, test-org — B-4 IS NOW DUE). ✅ LANDED.** Split `Kue/Tests/EvalTests.lean`
  (was 1792 lines, 8 under the 1800 cap) by theme into four sibling modules, all comfortably under
  cap: `EvalTests.lean` (494 — refs/selectors/memoization/structural-cycles/terminating-disjuncts/
  scalar+list embedding carriers), `EvalExprTests.lean` (581 — arithmetic/comparison/logical/unary/
  regex expression eval, reference cycles, value aliases, default-disjunction resolve, F1 default-mark
  algebra, disjunction-meet sweep), `EvalOpsTests.lean` (488 — float mul/div/add-sub, arithmetic
  operator domain E#4, scalar comparison/boolean/unary op pins), `EvalStructEqTests.lean` (283 —
  in-struct sibling merge, lazy meet, concrete struct/list equality). Verbatim move: 231 theorems
  conserved exactly (65+62+76+28). All three new modules registered in `Kue/Tests.lean`; each carries
  its own `#check @` coverage tripwire. **B-4 discharged.** Follow-up: PB-TESTORG-4 for
  `BuiltinTests`/`TwoPassTests` (both under cap, rising).

- **PB-TESTORG-4 (LOW, test-org — follow-up to PB-TESTORG-1).** `Kue/Tests/BuiltinTests.lean` (1669)
  and `TwoPassTests.lean` (1542) are the next-tightest hand-authored test modules — both under the
  1800 cap but rising. Deferred from PB-TESTORG-1 (EvalTests was the urgent one, 8 under cap; these
  have headroom and forcing a bad thematic cut in the same slice was the wrong trade). Split each by
  theme when either nears the cap. Also dedupe `testdata/` where fixtures overlap.

- **PB-DOCGRAPH-2 (LOW, doc currency). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-12, STRINGFORMAT-LEAF).** `architecture.md`
  §5 got the four stdlib-package leaves (`Path`/`Time`/`Net`/`TextTemplate`) inline at audit time;
  this slice adds the `StringFormat` leaf, records `Time`/`Net` as independent siblings (no
  `Time → Net`), and rewrites the plan §"Durable whole-graph facts" edge list to match — done ONCE
  after the edge was resolved, as planned.

- **PB-RELEASE-3 (LOW, tooling consistency).** `scripts/release.sh:43` builds via bare
  `lake build kue` (in a `cd $REPO_ROOT` subshell) — it does NOT route through the `./lake` wrapper
  (no repo-root on `PATH`, no `LEAN_NUM_THREADS=2`/`nice` cap), so a release build saturates every
  core, contrary to the slice-loop "build only via `./lake`" convention. Attended-only + infrequent,
  hence LOW, but the CPU-cap convention should hold for release too: prepend `repo_root` to `PATH`
  (mirroring `check.sh`) or call `"$REPO_ROOT/lake" build kue` directly. `release-linux.sh` builds in
  Docker, unaffected.

- **PB-CATCHALL-4 (NONE — cleared).** Swept the `| _ =>` occurrences in the three new leaves
  (`Time`/`Net`/`TextTemplate`): all produce internal parser/evaluator types (tuples, `Bool`,
  `Option NetAddr`, `TemplateResult`/`.unsupported`/`.bottom`) over their OWN data — none is a match on
  `Value`/AST that produces a `Value`, so the ban does not apply. Recorded so a future audit does not
  re-flag them. The `.stringFormat`/`.stringRegex` Value-level dispatch (Phase A verdict) stays
  catch-all-free.

**STDLIB-batch two-phase audit followup (2026-07-10, `4625079..2c3659b`).** Three remaining LOW/polish
findings closed in one audit-followup slice; one new leniency bug QUEUED.
- **Phase-B LOW-1 — `BuiltinFamily` stale doc comment. ✅ CLOSED (2026-07-10).** The doc said "eight
  exact unqualified builtins" / "seven qualified stdlib packages"; the counts had drifted to NINE
  core names (`close`/`len`/`and`/`or`/`div`/`mod`/`quo`/`rem` + the `slice` desugar) and NINE
  qualified families. Corrected to reality in `Kue/Builtin.lean`.
- **Phase-B LOW-2 — two package-set encodings unpinned. ✅ CLOSED (2026-07-10).** `builtinPackageNames`
  (`Value.lean`, import gate) and `BuiltinFamily.ofName?` (`Builtin.lean`, dispatch classifier)
  independently enumerate the qualified stdlib set with nothing cross-checking them. New
  `native_decide` theorem `every_builtin_package_resolves_to_family` (`ImportEnforcementTests`) pins
  every `n ∈ builtinPackageNames` to `(ofName? (n ++ ".SomeFn")).isSome`, so a future package added
  to one list but not the other fails the gate. The exhaustive-constructor `ofName?` match is kept
  (deliberate traceability, prior ruling); the theorem is the sync tool, not a data-drive.
- **Phase-A finding #3 — strconv deferred-function diagnostics. ✅ CLOSED (2026-07-10).** A concrete
  call to a deferred-but-recognized builtin (`strconv.Quote`/`Unquote`/`FormatFloat`/`ParseFloat`)
  bottomed with `.unsupportedBuiltin <name>` but the CLI rendered it as the generic `conflicting
  values (bottom)`. Mirroring STDLIB-E's render approach: new `ManifestError.unsupportedBuiltinFunction`
  (`Manifest.lean`, routed via `unsupportedBuiltinName?` in `manifestWithFuel`) renders in
  `Runtime.formatManifestError` as `unsupported builtin function "strconv.Quote": recognized but not
  yet implemented in kue`. Pins: `StrconvTests` `quote_render_message` (message) + `atoi_still_exports`
  (implemented call still concrete).
- **BLOCK-COMMENT-REJECT — ✅ LANDED (2026-07-11).** kue accepted C-style block comments `/* */`
  that CUE's grammar (only `//` line comments) forbids. Fix: removed `dropBlockComment` and its
  three call sites (`skipTrivia`/`skipSameLineTrivia`/`fieldSeparatorAux` in `Kue/Parse.lean`), so a
  `/*` surfaces as a stray `/` (division) whose operand `*` is not a valid primary — every position
  now rejects with `parse error: … unexpected character` (mirrors cue, which also has no
  block-comment concept). `ModCmd.lean`'s module-file scanner lost its now-unreachable `.block` Lex
  state (module.cue is parsed by `parseSource`, which rejects block comments before any textual scan).
  Guards: wild fixture `block-comment-rejected` (red→green) + `ParseTests` `parse_block_comment_*`
  (six reject positions + line-comment/division regression pins) + `ModCmdTests` applyModGet rejection.

**STDLIB-TIME Phase-A audit followup (2026-07-11).** Three findings from the `56fe65e` Phase-A
audit, all closed in one slice.
- **MEDIUM — RFC3339 offset over-lenient. ✅ CLOSED (2026-07-11).** `validRFC3339Offset`
  (`Kue/Time.lean`) did structural-only offset validation — any two digits passed. cue/Go's
  `time.Parse` RANGE-checks it: hour ≤ 24, minute ≤ 60 (both inclusive — boundary pinned against
  the v0.16.1 binary: `+24:00`/`+24:60` accept, `+25:00`/`+24:61`/`+12:61`/`+00:61` reject). Fix:
  bind and check the two offset fields (`offHour ≤ 24 ∧ offMin ≤ 60`). Guards: wild fixture
  `rfc3339-offset-overrange` (red→green) + `TimeTests` `time_offset_*` boundary theorems. The
  stale "offset NOT range-checked" claims in `cue-spec-gaps.md` and this plan were corrected in
  the same slice (retraction).
- **LOW-1 — missing over-range + disj-arm coverage. ✅ CLOSED (2026-07-11).** Added the over-range
  offset rejection/boundary theorems above, plus `dur_abstract_disj_arm_survives` (the
  `stringFormat` disj-arm-survival twin of `minrunes_abstract_disj_arm_survives`: an abstract
  `string & time.Duration()` arm survives finalization, not fabricated-pruned to the concrete
  `"1h"` arm). Promoted `manifestValueOk` to the shared `EvalTestHelpers` (was a private copy in
  `FixtureTests`).
- **LOW-2 — undemonstrated fractional-division divergence. ✅ RESOLVED — divergence CONFIRMED
  (2026-07-11).** The audit's 22 fractional cases all matched cue, but a hard probe near the
  float64 rounding boundary found a genuine one: `time.ParseDuration("0.00427738455750h")` is
  exactly 15398584407 ns (remainder-free integer division), cue's float64 `leadingFraction`
  returns 15398584406 (one ns low). kue is spec-correct (a Duration is an exact int64 ns count).
  Logged in `cue-divergences.md`; pinned by `TimeTests` `pd_fractional_hour_exact_beats_cue_float`.
  The comment + gap entry were tightened from a hypothetical to the demonstrated divergence.

**BLOCK-COMMENT-REJECT + STDLIB-PATH two-phase audit followup (2026-07-11).** One coherent
cleanup slice folding four findings; the two remaining are deferred to a future test-org pass.
- **B-1 (MEDIUM) — builtin dispatch fallback unify + diagnostic adjudication. ✅ LANDED
  (2026-07-11).** Three fallback shapes collapsed to one: a new `unsupportedOrBottom` combinator
  (sibling of `unresolvedOrBottom`, differing only in the all-concrete branch — `unsupportedBuiltin`
  marker vs bare bottom) replaces the two byte-identical inline blocks in `evalStrconvBuiltin` /
  `evalRegexpBuiltin`. **Adjudication** (cue v0.16.1 probed): cue has NO "unsupported" concept — a
  nonexistent leaf (`strconv.Itoa`, `regexp.FindString`/`Split`) and an unimplemented-but-real one
  both hit its `cannot call non-function` bottom, while a real leaf it DOES implement (`FormatFloat`,
  `Quote`, `FindNamedSubmatch`) returns a VALUE. So the `unsupportedBuiltin` marker is a POSITIVE
  recognition claim, emitted ONLY from an EXPLICIT dispatch arm that names a real-but-deferred leaf
  (strconv `FormatFloat`/`ParseFloat`/`Quote`/`Unquote`/`QuoteToASCII`; regexp `FindNamedSubmatch`/
  `FindAllNamedSubmatch`); the catch-all defaults to bare bottom (default-deny — it can't substantiate
  recognition without a cue-function registry). This CORRECTS the prior blunt "mark every concrete
  leaf", which mislabeled nonexistent `Itoa`/`FindString` as "recognized" (their own comments admitted
  they aren't cue functions). Recorded in `cue-spec-gaps.md` (B-1 row). Pins flipped: `itoa_deferred`→
  `itoa_nonexistent_is_bottom`, `regexp_findstring_is_unsupported`→`regexp_findstring_nonexistent_is_bottom`;
  new `regexp_findnamedsubmatch_is_unsupported`; `parsefloat_deferred`/`quote_deferred`/`quote_render_message`
  stay green.
- **B-2 (LOW) — stale `unresolvedOrBottom` doc. ✅ LANDED.** Dropped the "upcoming `math.*`" rollout
  enumeration; the doc now states the contract (catch-all → bottom-or-defer; recognized leaves route
  through `unsupportedOrBottom` from their own arm).
- **F1 (LOW) — duplicate trivia skippers collapsed. ✅ LANDED.** `skipPostfixTrivia` was byte-identical
  to `skipSameLineTrivia` (both: `[]`→`[]`, skip horizontal ws else stop; only arm order + name
  differed — verified truly identical before collapsing). Deleted `skipPostfixTrivia`, repointed its
  three callsites (`parseSelectorRest` ×2, `parseIdentifierValue`) to `skipSameLineTrivia`.
- **F2 (LOW) — interpolation block-comment reject pin. ✅ LANDED.** New `ParseTests`
  `parse_block_comment_in_interpolation_rejected`: `"\( 1 /* c */ )"` rejects with `unexpected
  character '*'` (the interpolation body parses through `parseExpression`, so the stray-`/`-division
  mechanism applies there too — hardening pin).
- **B-3 — DROPPED (moot as framed, 2026-07-11 audit-fold).** The reported per-file `call`/`s`/`i`
  test-helper duplication was grep-confirmed NOT to exist; no shared helper to extract.
- **B-4 (LOW) — ✅ DISCHARGED via PB-TESTORG-1 (2026-07-12).** The periodic test-org pass ran:
  `EvalTests.lean` (the module actually at the cap) was split by theme into four sibling modules.
  The originally-scoped `strings.*` extraction from `BuiltinTests.lean` folds into the PB-TESTORG-4
  follow-up (BuiltinTests/TwoPassTests split), scheduled when either nears the cap.

**STDLIB-B-PHASEB two-phase audit followup (2026-07-11).** One coherent low-risk cleanup slice
folding four Phase-B findings.
- **2A (MEDIUM) — unified list-item extraction. ✅ LANDED (2026-07-11).** `finalizeLengthConj`
  (`Kue/Lattice.lean`) matched only `.list` in its `uniqueVerdict` path, MISSING
  `.listTail`/`.embeddedList` — a latent meet-vs-manifest divergence (meet's `classifyUniqueTarget`
  measured all three, manifest fabricated a pass for the two it skipped). Fixed by routing through
  the shared `listItems?` extractor. Layering: `listItems?` was in `EvalOps.lean` (above `Lattice`
  in the import graph — `Lattice → EvalOps` would cycle via `Builtin`), so HOISTED to `Value.lean`
  (lowest common module; both `Lattice` and `EvalOps` import it). All list-item extraction sites
  now share one coverage. Guard: `FixtureTests` `uniqueitems_listtail_meet_bottoms` +
  `uniqueitems_listtail_finalize_bottoms` (meet and manifest agree on a ground `.listTail` dup).
- **1B (LOW) — `isConcreteArg` renamed `isSettledArg`. ✅ LANDED.** The name lied: it checks
  dispatch-settled SHAPE (true for abstract `.list [int]`, false for concrete `.struct {a:1}`), not
  concreteness — a groundness-gate bug magnet. Pure rename + doc pointing to `Value.isGround` for
  real groundness; callers `unresolvedOrBottom`/`unsupportedOrBottom` (`Builtin.lean`), `runSort`
  (`Eval.lean`). Dispatch semantics untouched. Note: the `Eval.lean` `runSort` catch-all reaches
  `isSettledArg` only for a non-`.list` first arg (`.list` handled upstream), so `isSettledArg`'s
  `.list => true` arm is dead FOR THAT CALLSITE — but live for the `Builtin.lean` callers, so not
  removable; left as-is.
- **3A (LOW) — stale renamed symbols in `cue-spec-gaps.md`. ✅ LANDED (retraction duty).** Rows
  STDLIB-STRUCT-FIELDCOUNT / FIELDCOUNT-DISJ named the pre-rename `fieldCountConstraint`,
  `FieldCountBound`, `applyFieldCountConstraint`, `finalizeFieldCountConj`; refreshed to
  `lengthConstraint .fields`, `CountBound`, `applyLengthConstraint`, `finalizeLengthConj`.
- **2B (MEDIUM) — DEFERRED, COUPLED to the next validator shape.** Wrap validator constructors in a
  single `.validator (v : Validator)` to collapse the ~8 shotgun-edit enumeration sites (every match
  that lists `.uniqueItems`/`.lengthConstraint`/… by hand). Pays off only at the 3rd validator
  shape — do NOT do speculatively; land it when `list.IsSorted` or the next validator is scheduled.

0. **AUDIT-QUOTED-BEQ (HIGH — correctness regression from `f128600`). DONE (2026-07-04);
   MECHANISM SUPERSEDED by ARCH-QUOTED-STRIP (0c, 2026-07-05).** The "STRIP route" +
   "no custom instance" resolution below is HISTORICAL: `stripFieldQuoting` is deleted and
   `Field.quoted` is now the `Quoted` newtype (inert `BEq`), which makes the leak
   type-unrepresentable without any strip pass. Read 0c for the live mechanism.
   `Field.quoted : Bool` was added to `Value.lean` AND included in the derived `BEq` for
   `Value`/`Field`/`ClosedClause`. `quoted` is parse-time provenance for the load-time no-shadow
   check ONLY, but it was NOT inert to evaluation: it leaked into every `Value`-`BEq` site, so two
   structs CUE deems identical (`{x:1}` vs `{"x":1}`) compared UNEQUAL and `dedupAlternatives`
   failed to collapse `d: {x:1} | {"x":1}` (kue `ambiguous value`, cue `{x:1}`). Fixed via the
   STRIP route: `Parse.stripFieldQuoting` — a total, enumerated (no catch-all) `Value` walk
   mirroring `canonicalizeBuiltinCalls` — normalizes every `Field.quoted → false` at both
   parse→eval seams (`parseDocument`, `parseDocumentFile`), AFTER `checkLetFieldShadow` reads the
   true quoting. Derived `BEq`/`DecidableEq` then see a uniform `false` and stay consistent (no
   custom instance). Seed graduated; dedup + nested-list + necessary-quoting fixtures + 4
   `native_decide` theorems added; all 24 `noshadow_*` theorems intact; real-world gate empty.

   **Split-out (the `==` symptom was NOT this bug):** `({x:1}) == ({"x":1})` still errors
   `incomplete value` — filed as **AUDIT-STRUCT-EQ** below. `evalEq` DEFERS all non-`.prim`
   operands before any `BEq`, so the strip never reaches the `==` operator; struct `==` was simply
   never implemented. Orthogonal to label quoting.

0b. **AUDIT-STRUCT-EQ — ✅ FULLY CLOSED (half-1 2026-07-04, half-2 2026-07-05).** (MEDIUM — feature
   gap + pre-existing divergence). RE-SCOPED by the 2026-07-04 Phase B audit: SPLIT into an
   autonomous-safe half and a deferred half; BOTH now landed. `Kue/EvalOps.lean:evalEq`
   handles only `.prim`; every struct/list `==`/`!=` defers to `.binary .eq` → `incomplete value`
   (all-bare `({x:1}) == ({x:1})` defers identically — not a quoting issue). cue reduces concrete
   struct/list `==` to a bool. TWO entangled issues: (1) reduce concrete struct/list operands to
   bool, deferring while non-concrete (`{x:int} == {x:int}`, which cue also leaves unreduced);
   (2) cue struct `==` is ORDER-INDEPENDENT (`{a:1,b:2} == {b:2,a:1}` → `true`), but kue's struct
   equality is raw order-SENSITIVE `Value` `BEq` (no canonical field sort) — the SAME model makes
   kue's disjunction dedup diverge on reordered fields (`{a:1,b:2} | {b:2,a:1}` → `ambiguous`, cue
   collapses; logged in `cue-divergences.md`).

   **Phase B architectural verdict (2026-07-04):**
   - **DO NOT redefine the global `Value` `BEq` to be order-independent.** It is used for structural
     CYCLE detection (`Eval.lean:292 structStack.contains bodyVal`; comment: "Identity is exact
     `Value` equality") and builtin-arg dedup (`Lattice.lean:394`). Order-independence is a COARSER
     equality → distinct-order structs would collide → spurious cycle false-positives + changed
     dedup semantics globally. `satCache`/`cache` are keyed on `valueDigest`, NOT full `BEq`, so
     they are unaffected either way.
   - **Half (1) — `evalEq` concrete struct/list `==` — ✅ DONE (2026-07-04).** `Kue/EvalOps.lean`
     adds `structEqConcrete? : Value → Value → Option Bool`, reachable ONLY from `evalEq`'s
     non-`prim`/non-`bottom` arm. Concreteness guard FIRST (`isConcrete` + `containsBottom`) →
     `none` (defer) unless BOTH operands are fully concrete and bottom-free, mirroring the manifest
     output-field filter (regular fields only; required defers; hidden/def/`let`/import/optional/
     pattern ignored). Then `concreteEq`: structs compare ORDER-INDEPENDENTLY over regular output
     fields (equal count + label-matched equal values); lists ORDER- and LENGTH-sensitively;
     primitives reuse the decimal-aware leaf equality; cross-shape → `false`. `evalNe`/`.ne` inherit
     the negation. Seed `struct-equality-quoted-labels-defers` graduated; 5 export fixtures +
     `struct-equality-incomplete-defers` wild guard + 14 `native_decide` theorems; gate green;
     real-world gate empty. Probe-matrix matches cue v0.16.1 on the tested cases (reordered/
     quoted/hidden-ignored/nested/open-tail/cross-shape/lists/scalar `1==1.0`) — but the "matches
     EXACTLY" claim was overstated: the 2026-07-04 Phase A audit found the matrix MISSED int-vs-float
     leaves inside containers (`[1.0]==[1]`, `{a:1.0}=={a:1}` → kue `true`, cue `false`). Filed as
     **STRUCT-EQ-LEAF-TYPESENSE** (0d below). NESTED `embeddedScalar`
     field values stay deferred (isConcrete → false): a safe, exotic residual, not a regression.
   - **Half (2) — order-independent `dedupAlternatives` — ✅ DONE (2026-07-05).** `Lattice.lean`
     adds `normalizeFieldOrder : Value → Value` (a field-ORDER normal form: every struct-bearing
     constructor's member list sorted by label via `sortFieldsByLabel`, sub-values normalized
     recursively; list element order PRESERVED; `termination_by structural`, total) and
     `eqUpToFieldOrder := normalizeFieldOrder left == normalizeFieldOrder right`. `dedupAlternatives`
     now tests arm equality with `eqUpToFieldOrder` (NOT the global order-sensitive `BEq`) and keeps
     the INCOMING (earlier-in-list) arm's value, so `{a:1,b:2} | {b:2,a:1}` collapses to one arm
     displaying the first-declared order — matching cue byte-for-byte. Chosen route: a canonical
     normal form (order-independence BY CONSTRUCTION) over an ad-hoc order-insensitive compare. The
     global `Value` `BEq` is UNTOUCHED — cycle detection (`Eval.lean` `structStack.contains`) still
     relies on exact equality; the coarser equality is confined to the dedup path. Over-collapse
     guarded: differing value / label-set / openness / field-class / list-element-order all stay
     distinct. 17 `native_decide` theorems (`LatticeTests` `structeq_*`) + `structeq_disj_reorder`
     export fixture (reordered/three-way/nested, kue == cue). `./scripts/check.sh` GREEN;
     real-world gate in-gate GREEN. The reordered-dedup divergence is REMOVED from
     `cue-divergences.md` (kue now agrees with cue and spec). **AUDIT-STRUCT-EQ is fully CLOSED.**

0c. **ARCH-QUOTED-STRIP — ✅ DONE (2026-07-05, Option B).** `Field.quoted` was parse provenance on
   the eval-layer `Value.Field`, made inert only by a `Parse.stripFieldQuoting` walk at the two
   parse→eval seams — an UNENFORCED "any pre-eval producer setting `quoted := true` must feed through
   the strip" invariant that already bit once (AUDIT-QUOTED-BEQ). **Mechanism deviation from the
   filed plan:** the filed durable fix ("drop `quoted` entirely; have `parsedFieldsValue` bubble a
   collidable-label set up through its recursion") was found INFEASIBLE in-slice — `parsedFieldsValue`
   is NOT recursive over the subtree and there is no `ParsedField` subtree: nested structs are already
   fully-built `Value`s (with `Field.quoted`) by the time they arrive, so the reverse no-shadow check
   (`collidableFieldLabel`/`collectFieldNames`) walks the built `Value`, including structs embedded
   arbitrarily deep inside expressions. Dropping the field would require threading a provenance set
   through the ENTIRE expression parser (a parser-wide return-type change), not ~1 slice. **Chosen
   (Option B):** `Field.quoted : Quoted` — a newtype whose `BEq` IGNORES its payload (`fun _ _ =>
   true`), keeping automatic `deriving Repr, BEq for Value, Field`. Quoting is now inert to every
   `Value`/`Field` equality BY CONSTRUCTION (the AUDIT-QUOTED-BEQ leak is type-unrepresentable, no
   producer can perturb equality), which also makes derived `BEq` consistent with `valueDigest` (which
   already omitted `quoted`) — the inconsistency the strip masked. `collidableFieldLabel` keeps reading
   the provenance (`field.quoted.value`); a `Coe Bool Quoted` leaves eval-layer field constructions
   writing a plain `false`. The ~55-line `stripFieldQuoting` walk + both seam calls are DELETED (not
   bypassed). Supersedes AUDIT-QUOTED-BEQ's "strip route / no custom instance" (rank 0 below): Option B
   keeps *derived* BEq — a one-line inert `BEq Quoted`, NOT a hand-rolled mutual `BEq Value`/`Field`,
   which was that decision's actual concern — so it supersedes cleanly. TDD red→green demonstrated
   (payload-respecting `BEq Quoted` ⇒ the `quoted_inert_*` pins + `ParseTests` dedup pins go RED; the
   digest-consistency pin stays green, proving BEq was the sole leak). 6 new `native_decide` theorems
   (`LatticeTests` `quoted_inert_*`); `./scripts/check.sh` GREEN; real-world gate byte-identical.

0d. **STRUCT-EQ-LEAF-TYPESENSE — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-07-04 Phase B, kue correct / cue buggy).**
   Adjudicated against the CUE spec: **value-based numeric equality applies recursively inside
   containers**, so kue's `1130638` code was already CORRECT and cue's `[1]==[1.0]=false` is a cue
   bug. Spec (Comparison operators): "Numeric values are equal if they represent the same number.
   When comparing an integer with a floating-point number, the integer is first converted to
   floating-point" + list/struct `==` are "recursively equal" over elements — recursive element
   equality reuses `==`, so the int→float carve-out applies at any depth. cue is internally
   INCONSISTENT (scalar `1==1.0`→`true`, container `[1]==[1.0]`→`false`); kue is value-based
   EVERYWHERE, hence spec-correct AND consistent. The Phase A "recommended: match cue / type-
   sensitive" lean was WRONG (would replicate the cue bug); the spec is EXPLICIT, not silent, so
   this is a `cue-divergences.md` entry, NOT a spec-gap. `1 & 1.0 = ⊥` does not bear on `==`
   (comparison ≠ unification). Landed inline: 6 `native_decide` theorems (int-vs-float in list,
   struct, nested-at-depth, unequal, `evalNe` negation) + 4 fixture cases in
   `numeric/equality_expressions` + the divergence record. No code change (kue was already right).

0e. **PRIM-FLOAT-PARSED ✅ LANDED 2026-07-05 (LOW-MEDIUM — type-system leverage + minor perf; from
   the 2026-07-04 Phase B audit).** `Prim.float` now carries `(value : DecimalValue) (text : String)`
   (was raw `String`), smart-constructed through the sole `mkFloatText` constructor which sets
   `value := parseDecimalText text` once at build time. `decimalFromPrim?` and `primsUnifyEqual` read
   the stored decimal with ZERO hot-path re-parse; the illegal `| _, _ => leftText == rightText`
   fallback in `primsUnifyEqual` is ERASED (the float arm is now a total `decimalEqValues` on the two
   stored values). `mathAbs`/`mathRound` also drop their per-call `parseDecimalText`. Behavior-
   preserving by construction: `value` is a deterministic function of `text`, so derived `BEq` on
   `Prim.float` still reduces to text-equality (fixtures + real-world gate byte-identical). 5 new
   `native_decide` theorems in `FloatTests.lean` pin the invariants (stored-decimal exactness/totality,
   by-value unify, verbatim text round-trip incl. trailing-zero/scientific, BEq≡text, bound edges).
   Original spec retained for provenance: `Prim.float` carried the raw literal `String` (`Kue/Value.lean:19`), so every
   float-vs-float meet (`primsUnifyEqual`, `Kue/Lattice.lean:14`) and every float compare
   (`toDecimalValue?`/`evalDecimalCompare?`) RE-PARSES the text via `parseDecimalText` on the hot
   path. Two smells: (1) repeated `parseDecimalText` work on a value that never changes, and (2) the
   `parseDecimalText` `Option` forces a `| _, _ => leftText == rightText` "can't happen" fallback in
   `primsUnifyEqual` (a float literal from the lexer ALWAYS parses) — exactly the illegal-state the
   repo wants erased at the type. **Fix: refine `Prim.float` to carry a smart-constructed
   `DecimalValue` alongside the source text** (`float (value : DecimalValue) (text : String)`, built
   once at lex time). Erases the re-parse AND the unreachable fallback branches; the retained `text`
   preserves round-trip rendering (GDA-FLOAT-RENDER's concern). Cost: `Prim.float` is a CORE type
   threaded through lexer/formatter/eval — a signature change touching many sites → its own MEDIUM
   slice, not an inline fix. Perf impact is real but small (float meets are a minority of meets);
   the primary win is illegal-states-unrepresentable. Couple with GDA-FLOAT-RENDER (both touch the
   float representation) if convenient.

0f. **BYTE-ARRAY-REPR ✅ LANDED 2026-07-05 (MEDIUM, core-type — ordinary test-first slice; from the
   2026-07-04 Phase B audit; CONSOLIDATES the bytes-as-String debt).** `Prim.bytes` now carries
   `Array UInt8` (was `String`). Fully CLOSED BYTE-HIGHBYTE — the `byte-literal-high-byte` seed
   graduated GREEN (`'\xff'`/`'\377'` → `/w==`, the single octet 0xFF). The three latent bugs were
   fixed at the same sites: `len` byte count (`.size`), `formatPrim` `\xNN`/named-escape byte encoder,
   lossy `.toUTF8` base64 (Json/Yaml/Builtin now encode the raw bytes). Also fixed the multiline-bytes
   escape gap (dedicated `parseMultilineByteBody` decoding byte escapes). **Prerequisite for
   BYTES-SLICE-MISSING and BYTE-INTERPOLATION is now MET** — both remain open dependents (below).
   Original spec retained for provenance: `Prim.bytes` carried a `String` (`Kue/Value.lean:21`),
   so a byte ≥0x80 cannot be represented as one octet — `decodeByteEscape` (`Parse.lean:182`) folds
   `\xNN`/`\NNN` through `Char.ofNat` into that codepoint's multi-byte UTF-8 form. This ONE loose
   representation is the root of THREE filed items: BYTE-HIGHBYTE (Json/Yaml base64 round-trips
   through lossy `.toUTF8`), BYTES-SLICE-MISSING (needs byte-indexed slicing), and BYTE-INTERPOLATION
   (byte-context carrier). **Verdict — CONSOLIDATE the repr change, keep the two feature follow-ups
   dependent.** Refine the carrier to a byte array. **Choose `Array UInt8`, NOT `ByteArray`:** it
   preserves the existing `deriving Repr, BEq, DecidableEq` on `Prim` (`Value.lean:22`) + `Hashable`
   for `digestPrim`, and keeps the `primsUnifyEqual_refl` proof (`Lattice.lean:23`) closing —
   `ByteArray` lacks `DecidableEq`/`Repr` in Lean core (a soundness snag). No interaction with the
   `Field.quoted` strip (that walks labels, never `Prim` payloads) or STRUCT-EQ (bytes compare by
   byte-array equality, cleaner than String). **Invasiveness MEDIUM: ~16 production sites across 9
   files** (Value, Parse×3, Lattice×2 +proof, EvalOps×3, Builtin×2, EvalBase×2, Format, Json, Yaml)
   + carrier-literal churn in ~6 test modules. The diff is CORRECTIVE, not just mechanical — it fixes
   three latent bugs at the SAME sites: `len('\xff')` (`Builtin.lean:36`, counts UTF-8 bytes → should
   be `.size`), `formatPrim` output (`Format.lean:60`, emits NO byte-escaping today — needs a `\xNN`
   encoder), and the lossy `.toUTF8` base64 (`Json.lean:54`/`Yaml.lean:311`/`Builtin.lean:780`).
   **What it unlocks vs. what stays separate:** fully CLOSES BYTE-HIGHBYTE (graduates
   `byte-literal-high-byte` — fold it INTO this slice). It is a PREREQUISITE that de-risks but does
   NOT subsume the other two: BYTES-SLICE-MISSING still needs its own byte-slice dispatch (repr just
   makes the impl a clean `Array.extract`); BYTE-INTERPOLATION still needs the byte-context carrier
   arm rippling ~20 match sites (repr makes segment concat a clean array append but the carrier
   plumbing is the bulk cost, independent of String-vs-array). So: land BYTE-ARRAY-REPR FIRST as a
   focused core-type slice (carrier + the 3 latent fixes + high-byte graduation), then BYTES-SLICE
   and BYTE-INTERPOLATION as small dependents. Also fixes the multiline-bytes escape gap
   (`parseMultilineBytes`, `Parse.lean:1434`, currently routes through the string escape lexer).
   Land it autonomously test-first: a core `Prim` change is not a stop condition (internal risk
   is absorbed by the gate + fixtures + audit, not human review) — pin the carrier + 3 latent
   fixes + high-byte graduation with `native_decide` theorems before the refactor.

1. **B3d-6b — FULLY LANDED 2026-07-05 (`kue mod tidy` + MVS + `cue.sum` write + main-pin fix +
   leg 4 export-path MVS + leg 2 `mod get`).** The substantive registry work landed: `kue mod tidy`
   fetches each transitive dependency's `module.cue` over the read-only registry GET, builds the
   `RequirementGraph`, runs the CHECKED MVS solver (`Mvs.solveChecked` — the main-pin fix: a dep
   requiring a higher version of the main module's own path is a typed error, not a silent pin),
   and WRITES `cue.sum` with the verified `h1:` digests. New `Kue/ModCmd.lean` (carved from
   `Module.lean`); offline gate `scripts/check-mod-tidy.lean` drives a diamond graph proving
   max-of-mins selection + cue.sum. **leg 4 LANDED 2026-07-05** (export-path MVS rewiring — the
   disk-built graph governs import resolution). **leg 2 LANDED 2026-07-05** (`kue mod get
   <module>[@version]` — deps-block emitter + `.../tags/list` "latest" resolution; see § B3d track).
   **B3d-6b is now fully closed** — no remaining FILED dependents.

2. **B2-A1 — RESOLVED-BY-PROBE (2026-07-04, non-bug).** The prior claim ("`applyEvaluatedStructN`
   routes the patterns-present case through a meet that DROPS `tail`") was STALE: `applyEvaluatedStructN`
   (`EvalBase.lean:342,350`) PRESERVES `tail` on both arms (empty-patterns → `mkStruct … tail`;
   patterns-present → the `tail` stays on the pattern-bearing struct fed to `meet`). Typed-tail
   application is already correct and theorem-pinned: `meet` rejects a wrong-typed ADDITIONAL field
   (`StructTests` `meet_typed_ellipsis_rejects_conflicting_extra_field`), accepts a matching one,
   and exempts a struct's OWN declared fields (`…does_not_constrain_declared_field_by_tail`) — which
   is why `applyEvaluatedStructN` correctly leaves its own explicit fields untouched. **No source
   reaches this path:** `{...T}` is rejected at parse in BOTH kue (`Parse.lean:1483` "typed struct
   ellipsis is not supported yet") and cue v0.16.1 ("missing ',' in struct literal") — the CUE spec
   marks `...expr` reserved-but-unimplemented. Lists differ: `[...T]` IS parsed+enforced by both,
   and kue matches cue (`[...int] & [1,"s"]` → bottom on both). Parse-rejection now guarded by
   `ParseTests` `parse_struct_typed_{ellipsis,top_ellipsis}_rejected`. Nothing to fix unless/until
   typed-ellipsis SYNTAX is implemented (a separate feature, not a soundness debt).

3. **scalar-embed provenance follow-ups (opportunistic).** Pins (3-level flatten, disj ops
   beyond `+` /`&`, composed select-into-F1-default) when next touching Lattice/Eval.

**LOW tail (opportunistic; none block adoption):**
- **e-followup** — timeless-comment sweep of `Tests/` (~20 clear code-history comments remain:
  `PresenceTests`, `TwoPassTests`, `ComprehensionTests`, `ModuleTests`, `YamlTests`,
  `ClosureTests`, `LatticeTests`, `EvalPerfTests`, `BuiltinTests`, `EvalTests`, `FixturePorts`).
  Convert on-touch or as a dedicated sweep.
- **item-3 testdata regroup (DEFERRED)** — sub-grouping `testdata/cue/{definitions,
  comprehensions}` into nested subdirs; high blast radius (`FixturePorts.lean`'s `fileName`
  strings are the join key, ~77 fixtures). Pick up as a dedicated careful slice or drop.
- **B3d-B1 — DONE 2026-07-10.** `Kue.Hash1` newtype now wraps the `cue.sum` `h1:<base64>` token
  end-to-end (produce `Sha256.hash1` → accumulate `fetchGraph`/`cueSumRows` → parse/format
  `parseCueSumText`/`formatCueSum` → verify `fetchAndCacheModule`); `Hash1.parse`/`render` are the
  file-format boundary. The OCI `Descriptor.digest` (`sha256:<hex>`) stays a bare `String`
  (separate concern). **kue-performance B3d note** still open. (B3d-A2, Mvs.solve main-pin, and
  the `ModuleFetch` carve all LANDED 2026-07-05.)
- **GATE-KNOWNRED-DRY (LOW, infra; from the 2026-07-04 Phase B / A7 rotation) — DONE.**
  The two copy-pasted three-state `.known-red` blocks in `check_wild_fixtures` and
  `check_module_subpaths` are replaced by one `handle_known_red <known_red> <passed> <grad_label>
  <quar_label>` helper: it emits the graduation/quarantine diagnostic and returns a verdict
  (0 = quarantined-skip, 1 = graduation hard-fail, 2 = not-quarantined → caller's own pass/fail
  handling). Each caller passes a preformatted label so its wording stays byte-identical to
  before (wild: `<slug>` / `wild fixture <cue>`; module: `module fixture <dir> subpath <sub>` for
  both). Behavior EXACTLY preserved; shellcheck-clean; `check.sh` green. Three-state verdict
  smoke-tested in isolation (no live `.known-red` currently exists).
- **A2-x (latent) — `importBinding` merge-asymmetry.** STAYS unobservable (the only collision
  that would exercise it is the one A2-y rejects at LOAD). No work; recorded so it is not
  re-investigated.
- **AUDIT-RESOLVE-CATCHALL (LOW, pre-existing, latent) — DONE.** `mapRefsValueWithFuel`'s
  trailing `| _, _, value => value` catch-all is REPLACED by 13 explicit pass-through arms (the
  leaves + `refId`/`thisStruct`/`embeddedList`/`embeddedScalar`/`closure`), so exhaustiveness is
  now compiler-proven — a new `Value` ctor fails the build at this rewrite site instead of being
  silently swallowed. Byte-identical behavior (all swallowed ctors were pass-through under the
  catch-all and remain so; `closure` stays pass-through — it owns its `capturedEnv`, not the
  enclosing `scopes`; `embeddedList`/`embeddedScalar` are eval-only, never present at the two
  pre-eval call sites). No latent bug surfaced. real-world gate EMPTY; `check.sh` green.
- **UNUSED-IMPORT-BINDNAME / AUD-B6 (MEDIUM — latent false-positive; filed by the `0427bf1..HEAD`
  Phase A audit) — DONE 2026-07-06.** RETRACTION: this entry's original diagnosis assumed `cue`
  ACCEPTS a bare `import ".../x/foo"` whose dir declares `package bar` (used as `bar.Field`) and
  expected the fix to make Kue return NON-bottom. That premise is WRONG: `cue` v0.16.1 REJECTS such a
  program — `no files in package directory with package name "foo"` — requiring the `:bar` qualifier.
  So `importLocalBindName` dropping the `declaredName` arm can only mis-flag programs `cue` itself
  rejects; teaching the check the `declaredName` arm would make Kue wrongly ACCEPT a `cue`-illegal
  import. Resolved instead as the F-3 suffix-vs-declared-name MISMATCH gate: `collectBindings`
  enforces the loaded `package` clause == expected name (qualifier, else last path element), a
  cue-shaped load error on divergence. This keeps `importBindName` purely lexical (param-free, moved
  to `Value.lean`, one resolution shared by parse-time check + loader binder; `importLocalBindName`
  deleted) so the parse-time unused check can never mis-name a bound import. (The
  `collectReferencedHeads` WALK was always false-positive-safe — exhaustive, no catch-all, `[]` arms
  carry no `Value`; the gap was never the reference walk.) Fixtures `import_bare_pkgname_mismatch`
  (expected.err) + `import_qualifier_pkgname_rescue`.

### SCOPING / REFERENCE-RESOLUTION PROBE (2026-07-12) — four defects seeded, clean majority pinned

Systematic differential hunt over CUE lexical scoping + reference resolution vs cue v0.16.1
(shadowing, `let` scoping, field/value aliases, pattern label aliases, hidden fields,
comprehension-var scope, cross-scope refs, self/mutual cycles). **Value-level CONFORMANT**
across most of the matrix — MEASURED + pinned (`testdata/export/scoping_*.{cue,json}`):
inner-field shadowing (`z: x` picks nearest), comprehension-var shadowing an outer field +
nested-`for` shadowing, forward `let`→`let` and `let`→later-field visibility, `let` in a
comprehension, hidden-field (`_x`) reference scope, field value alias (`X={…}` ref `X.b`),
field self-cycle → top (`x: x & {a:1}` ⇒ `{a:1}`, `x: x & int` ⇒ `int`), hidden-vs-regular
same-name namespaces, ref resolving up the scope chain, `let`/field shadow load-error (both
directions, pre-pinned). **Four defects found + seeded RED** (`.known-red`, all filed below):

- **SELF-CONJ-CYCLE (HIGH correctness — wrong value; kue BUG). ✅ LANDED (2026-07-12).** A field
  body with a self-reference BURIED below its top-level conjuncts (`x: 1` + `x: x & int`, merged
  to `.conj [1, (x & int)]`; equally the single-field `x: (x & int) & 1`) ⇒ kue `_|_` where cue
  resolves self→top and yields `{x: 1}`. ROOT CAUSE: `flattenConjDefRef` (`Kue/EvalBase.lean`)
  inlined the self-referential field body, REPLACING the bare `refId x` with x's body — which
  re-buries the self-ref one level deeper. Its `expanding` guard bounds only TOP-LEVEL self-ref
  conjuncts (Bug2-12's `#X: #X & {a}`); a NESTED self-ref (inside `(x & int)`, a `.conj`, not a
  bare ref) escaped and unrolled to fuel exhaustion, bottoming instead of collapsing to top. The
  `slotVisited ⇒ truncate .top` guard in the `.refId` eval arm was never reached because the bare
  ref was consumed by the flatten before it could be evaluated. FIX: `flattenConjDefRef` bails
  (returns the ref UNEXPANDED) when a body conjunct that is NOT a direct top-level self-ref
  transitively references the same slot at depth 0 (new `valueMentionsSlotAtDepth`); the bare ref
  then flows to the `.refId` arm and truncates correctly. Bug2-12 direct-self-ref close path
  untouched. Over-truncation guard holds (`x: 1` + `x: x & 2` still `_|_`). Seed
  `testdata/wild/self-conj-cycle/` green; 9 `Bug2xTests` theorems added.
- **LET-CYCLE-ERROR (MEDIUM — missing load error; kue too lenient). ✅ LANDED 2026-07-12.** A `let`
  binding is not in scope in its own RHS: `let a = a` ⇒ `reference "a" not found`; mutual
  `let a = c; let c = a` ⇒ `cyclic references in let clause or alias`. kue had collapsed a
  struct-level `let` self/mutual cycle to top like a FIELD self-cycle, masking the error. FIX
  (no scope-model change; the let-vs-field nature is read at the guard, not threaded): the
  reference-cycle guard (`Kue/Eval.lean`, depth-0 `slotVisited`) now inspects the DETECTED cycle's
  slot classes off the live frame — `cycleSlots`/`allLetCycle` (`EvalBase.lean`). A cycle sitting
  ENTIRELY on `letBinding` slots raises `.bottomWith [.letClauseCycle label isMutual]`
  (`isMutual := cycle length > 1`); a cycle touching ANY field keeps the field-self `truncate .top`
  rule (`x: x` → `_`, `let a = x; x: a` → `_` — over-correction guard). Manifest surfaces the reason
  (`letClauseCycleReason?`, like the unused-import path) as cue's load-error text
  (`ManifestError.letClauseCycle`). Seed `testdata/wild/let-self-cycle-error/` RED→GREEN; wild
  fixtures `let-{mutual-cycle-error,arith-self-cycle-error,cycle-through-field-top,chain-valid}`;
  6 theorems in `EvalTests.lean` (self/arith/mutual error + field-cycle-top/valid-chain/field-self
  both-direction guards). `buildFrame` unchanged — resolution still binds the let in the shared
  frame; the distinction lives entirely in the eval cycle classifier.
- **PATTERN-LABEL-ALIAS (MEDIUM — missing feature + parse gap). ✅ LANDED 2026-07-12 for STRUCT
  constraint bodies; non-struct body split to PATTERN-LABEL-ALIAS-SCALAR.** `[Name=string]: {n:
  Name}` binds `Name` to each matched field's concrete label. `parsePatternField` now reads an
  optional `ident=` alias prefix (`patternAliasHead?`, skipping `==`/`=~`) and desugars it onto the
  constraint via `bindPatternAlias`: a non-output `letBinding ⟨name, patternLabel name⟩` prepended
  to the (struct) body, so ordinary lexical resolution routes `Name` references to the new
  `Value.patternLabel` placeholder. The placeholder survives eval unchanged and is substituted to
  the matched label string at pattern application (`applyPatternToFieldWith` via
  `substPatternLabel`, names read from the constraint's own top-level alias bindings). Covers
  multiple-field, top/comparator patterns, nested + cross-scope aliases, concrete-field interaction,
  and scope non-leak; `[Name=~…]` correctly stays a regex pattern. Theorems
  `Kue/Tests/PatternAliasTests.lean`; seed `testdata/wild/pattern-label-alias/` GREEN.
- **PATTERN-LABEL-ALIAS-SCALAR (LOW — spec-conformance gap; kue bottoms where cue yields a value).
  OPEN.** A NON-struct pattern constraint body that references the alias (`[Name=string]: Name` ⇒
  cue `{"foo":"foo",…}`) has nowhere to host the desugared `letBinding`, so `bindPatternAlias`
  leaves the alias unresolved and kue bottoms. Fix: bind the alias via a synthetic frame at
  resolve+eval (uniform for struct and non-struct) OR wrap a non-struct body so the placeholder has
  a home. Recorded in `cue-divergences.md`. Split from PATTERN-LABEL-ALIAS (its struct-body half
  landed).
- **UNREFERENCED-ALIAS (LOW — missing validation; kue too lenient). OPEN.** A value alias
  never referenced (`a: X=1`) is a CUE load error (`unreferenced alias or let clause X`);
  kue silently accepts. The alias analog of the unused-import error kue already enforces —
  a use-tracking pass over aliases/lets in each scope. Seed
  `testdata/wild/unreferenced-value-alias/`.
- **LIST-ISSORTED (LOW — missing builtins; comparator-struct evaluation). OPEN (filed by
  LIST-OPS-PROBE 2026-07-13).** cue's `list.IsSorted(xs, cmp)` / `list.IsSortedFunc(xs, less)`
  are unimplemented: kue resolves the `list.Ascending`/`list.Descending` comparator VALUES to a
  struct but leaves the `IsSorted` call an unresolved residual (`list.IsSorted([1,2,3], {…})`),
  where cue yields `true`/`false`. Needs comparator-struct evaluation — the SAME deferred corner
  as `list.Sort`/`SortStable` (both apply a `{T, x, y, less}` comparator to element pairs); land
  IsSorted/IsSortedFunc/Sort/SortStable together when the comparator-application seam is built.
  Not a bounded probe fix (effectful/comparator corner, per the working agreement's "file it").

Spec-silent RENDERING note recorded in `cue-spec-gaps.md`: an irreducible self-cycle in an
arithmetic context (`a: a + 1`) is semantically top→`_ + 1` (kue prints the substituted
form); cue reprints the original `a + 1`. Values identical (both incomplete); render differs.

### PHASE A AUDIT (2026-07-12, batch `ecf489d..0091463`) — SELF-CONJ-CYCLE sound, 2 under-fire gaps + 1 incidental

Reconciliation: all prior-audit filings verified present + accurate (BOUND-OPERAND-CLASSIFY
`c6be867` ✅ LANDED, BINARY-CMP-OPERAND `4bb40b3` ✅ LANDED; BOUND-ORDEREDPRIM / BINARY-CMP-BYTES /
PA-ESC-2 / PA-SUB-4 / PA-TT-5 / PB-RELEASE-3 / PB-TESTORG-4 / PATTERN-LABEL-ALIAS / LET-CYCLE-ERROR
/ UNREFERENCED-ALIAS all still OPEN, none re-ranked
[RETRACTED 2026-07-12: PATTERN-LABEL-ALIAS ✅ LANDED for struct bodies; residual non-struct half is
PATTERN-LABEL-ALIAS-SCALAR]). SCOPING-PROBE guards non-vacuous (6 green,
verified); 3 remaining `.known-red` seeds present.

**SELF-CONJ-CYCLE verdict: SOUND for its targeted shape — NO over-fire regression.** Exhaustively
probed the over-inlining-suppression direction (the dangerous one): `x: {a:1} & {b: x.a}`,
`x: (x&{a:int}) & {a:1}`, forward self-ref `#X: {a: #X.b, b: 2}`, def buried self-sel
`#X: {a:1} & {b: #X.a}`, disj-guarded `x: (x&int) | 2`, Bug2-9 narrowing + Bug2-12 direct-self-ref
+ closed-def rejection — all resolve byte-identically to cue. The bail (`valueMentionsSlotAtDepth`)
correctly tracks depth (no shadow false-positive), excludes the direct-self-ref path, and fires only
on genuinely-buried same-slot mentions. `valueMentionsSlotAtDepth`/`foldValueWithDepth` are total,
fuel-bounded; the leaf's `| _ => none` means "descend structurally" (NOT a Value-producing dispatch),
so the `| _ =>` ban does not apply.

- **SELF-CONJ-CYCLE-INDIRECT (HIGH correctness — wrong value; kue BUG). ✅ LANDED 2026-07-12 for the
  index-layout shapes; shape 2 (field-selection cycle) re-filed as SELF-SELECT-CYCLE-CROSSFRAME.**
  Phase B's "two shapes, ONE root layer" framing was INCORRECT — instrumentation (this slice, per the
  mandatory instrument-first order) OBSERVED **two distinct roots**.

  **OBSERVED root #1 — resolve/eval index-layout mismatch (NOT a `visited`-truncation gap; closed).**
  `resolveStructRefs`/`buildFrame` assigned lexical slot indices against the RAW (duplicate-bearing)
  field layout, while the evaluator indexes the DEDUPLICATED layout (`canonicalizeFields`). When two
  same-label fields collapse into one canonical slot, every field AFTER the collapse shifts down one
  index — but a reference authored against the raw layout kept its stale higher index and dangled into
  `unresolvedBinding` → `meet(concrete, ⊥) = ⊥`, BEFORE the existing depth-0 `slotVisited ⇒ truncate
  .top` guard could ever apply. Pinned by tracing the `evalConjStandard` none-branch meet: for
  `x:1; x:y; y:1` the merged `x` body was `[prim 1, refId{index:2}]` and `refId{index:2}` resolved to
  `unresolvedBinding{index:2}` against the 2-slot canonical frame (`x@0, y@1`). This affects ANY
  forward reference across a collapsed duplicate — including a PLAIN sibling field (`x:1; x:1; y:5;
  z:y`), proving it is NOT confined to merged `.conj` bodies. **Fix:** `buildFrame` now indexes
  `canonicalFieldLayout fields` (a class-level mirror of `canonicalizeFields`' collapse decision, via
  `mergeFieldClass`), so resolve and eval agree by construction; the reference cycle then truncates via
  the existing `.refId` guard, unchanged. Shapes closed: `x:1; x:y; y:1` (dupfield) and `x:1; x:y&int;
  y:x` (sibling — Phase B's shape 1, also index-layout, not a cycle-path gap).

  Phase B's designed fix (thread `visited` through the `.conj` path) was a MISDIAGNOSIS: `visited` is
  already threaded through `evalConjStandard`'s none-branch — the static trace that predicted the
  correct value was right about the truncation; the escape was upstream, at reference RESOLUTION. The
  `0091463` `valueMentionsSlotAtDepth` bail was NOT removed — it handles a nested self-ref burial
  (`x: (x & int) & 1`) the index-layout fix does not touch, so it is not subsumed.

  **OBSERVED root #2 — cross-frame selector reference-cycle (re-filed, QUARANTINED).** Shape 2
  `x: {a: 1}` + `x: {a: x.a}` (⇒ kue `{x:{a:_|_}}`; cue `{x:{a:1}}`) has NO index shift. Its `_|_` is a
  distinct mechanism: `x.a` is evaluated by eagerly forcing the WHOLE enclosing struct `x` via a
  depth-1 self-reference, re-entering the in-progress `a` field; the frame-relative `visited` set
  RESETS on the depth-1 frame crossing (child-frame slot indices are meaningless in the parent), so the
  self-selection cycle (`a → a`) is not detected and bottoms structurally instead of truncating to top.
  Seed `testdata/wild/self-conj-cycle-fieldsel/` (`.known-red`). See SELF-SELECT-CYCLE-CROSSFRAME below.

  **Seeds (this slice):** `self-conj-cycle-{sibling,dupfield,fwdref}` GREEN; over-truncation guards
  `self-conj-cycle-{conflict,indirect-resolve}` GREEN (real conflict still ⊥; valid indirect resolve
  still resolves); `self-conj-cycle-fieldsel` QUARANTINED. Lean pins in `EvalTests.lean`
  (`dupfield_forward_ref_resolves`, `sibling_cycle_truncates_to_top`,
  `plain_ref_across_collapsed_dup_resolves`, `direct_self_conflict_still_bottoms`,
  `cyclic_conflict_still_bottoms`, `indirect_field_selection_still_resolves`).
- **SELF-SELECT-CYCLE-CROSSFRAME (MED correctness — wrong value; kue BUG). ✅ LANDED 2026-07-12.**
  `x: {a: 1}` + `x: {a: x.a}` ⇒ kue was `{x:{a:_|_}}`, now `{x:{a:1}}` (cue v0.16.1); the
  reference-cycle→top class is now CLOSED across same-frame + indirect (index-layout) + cross-frame.
  **Observed mechanism (instrumented, re-confirmed this slice):** `x`'s two-declaration value is a
  `.conj`; `x.a` eagerly forces the WHOLE enclosing `x` (`.selector (.refId x) a` → force base) and
  re-enters its in-progress body. A `.conj` body is NOT struct-like, so `structStack` never guards it —
  the re-entry recurses fuel-deep and bottoms (`isConj=true`, 25 unguarded `recurseBody` re-entries
  observed via trace-diff against a preamble baseline). A single `.struct` body instead bottoms via
  `structStack` as a FALSE structural cycle. The frame-relative `visited` set cannot carry slot identity
  across the frame crossing. **Fix (frame-stable identity, reused):** resolve `x.label` to `label`'s slot
  in the LIVE enclosing frame — found by `pushFrame`'s deterministic `(parentIds, fields)` frame identity
  (`enclosingSelfSelectId?`), NOT a label heuristic — so the self-selection inherits the depth-0
  `slotVisited ⇒ truncate .top` reference-cycle rule. Multi-selector chains (`x.a.b`) resolve through
  `selectChainId?` (recursive over `enclosingSelfSelectId?`). A cross-struct select whose target frame is
  not live (`y:{b:x.a}`) falls through to the ordinary force-then-select path. **Both-direction guards
  (green):** real conflict still ⊥ (`x:{a:x.a&2}`, deeper `x.a.b&2`); valid cross-frame select still
  resolves (`y:{b:x.a}`); label-coincidence (`z:{a:x.a}` — frame identity distinguishes it from a
  self-cycle). Seed `self-conj-cycle-fieldsel` GRADUATED (`.known-red` removed); new fixtures
  `self-select-{cycle-deeper,crossframe-valid,cycle-deeper-conflict}`. 9 Lean pins in `EvalTests.lean`
  (`self_select_*`). Helpers `structFrameLayout?`/`frameDepthOfId`/`enclosingSelfSelectId?`/
  `selectChainId?` in `EvalBase.lean`; selector arms in `Eval.lean`.
- **DEF-FLATTEN-CLOSEDNESS (MEDIUM correctness — kue too lenient; PRE-EXISTING). ✅ LANDED
  2026-07-12.** Fixed by widening `flattenConjDefRef`'s close gate with an `ownLiteralUnion`
  disjunct (`EvalBase.lean` ~1960): fires when every non-`.refId` conjunct is `isUnionableDefValue`
  and no `.refId` conjunct targets a DIFFERENT slot — so `#X: {a:1}&{b:3}` closes-once over `{a,b}`
  via the Bug2-12b union path while `#LS: #Base & {extra}` (cross-def `.refId` conjunct) stays on
  the OPEN-extension path. Seed `testdata/wild/def-flatten-closedness/` (RED→GREEN). 9 both-direction
  guards in `Bug2xTests.lean` (`defflatten_*`): reject own-union extra/conflict/nested/closed-base-ext;
  admit base/redeclare/opentail/open-extension/single-decl. kue matches cue v0.16.1 on every variant;
  no divergence. Bug2-6/2-7 + L-series + mutual/multi-ref closedness suites all stay green.
  A use-site adds fields a CLOSED multi-conjunct def should reject.
  `#X: {a:1} & {b:3}` + `y: #X & {c:4}` ⇒ kue `y: {a:1,b:3,c:4}` (closedness dropped ENTIRELY); cue
  rejects `c` (`field not allowed`). Contrast the single-decl `#X: {a:1, b:3}` + `y: #X & {c:4}` ⇒
  kue correctly `{a:1,b:3,c:_|_}` — its body is a single `.struct` (not a `.conj`), so
  `flattenConjDefRef` returns the bare `#X` ref unchanged and it resolves CLOSED via the `.refId` arm.

  **Root cause (observed):** `flattenConjDefRef`'s close gate `close := field.fieldClass.isDefinition
  && (isSelfRef || inCycle)` (`Kue/EvalBase.lean:1960`). A def whose body is a `.conj` of the def's
  OWN struct literals (`{a:1} & {b:3}` — all `isUnionableDefValue`, no ref conjuncts) is neither
  self-ref nor in-cycle, so `close=false`: the literals flatten OPEN and union into the use-site
  meet WITHOUT closing → closedness lost. The Bug2-12b close-once path (`mergeDefinitionDecls` +
  final `normalizeDefinitionValueWithFuel`) is exactly what a closed multi-literal def needs — it is
  just gated behind `isSelfRef || inCycle`, when the real discriminator is *the body's conjuncts are
  the def's own split literals* (all `isUnionableDefValue`), which the self-recursive case is only a
  sub-case of.

  **Coupling verdict (SUPERSEDED 2026-07-12).** The prior verdict said "SAME FUNCTION as
  SELF-CONJ-CYCLE-INDIRECT (`flattenConjDefRef`)". That assumed the cycle fix would land in
  `flattenConjDefRef`; it did NOT — the SELF-CONJ-CYCLE-INDIRECT root was a resolve-layer index-layout
  mismatch fixed in `Kue/Resolve.lean` (`buildFrame`/`canonicalFieldLayout`), untouched
  `flattenConjDefRef`. So there is NO function-level coupling and NO rebase-collision to coordinate;
  DEF-FLATTEN-CLOSEDNESS stands alone on `flattenConjDefRef`. **DESIGNED
  FIX:** widen `close` to also fire when every non-`.refId` body conjunct is `isUnionableDefValue`
  (the def's own literals) with NO cross-def ref-composition conjunct — so `{a:1}&{b:3}` closes-once
  over `{a,b}` while `#LS: #Base & {extra}` (a REF conjunct present) stays OPEN and defers to the
  outer close-once fold (Bug2-6..9), unchanged. Also covers the mutual-def variant `#A: #B & {a:int}`
  + `#B: #A & {b:int}` + `x: #A & {a:1,b:2}` (already partially served by `inCycle`; verify).
  Sequence: no coordination needed — the SELF-CONJ-CYCLE-INDIRECT fix landed in `Kue/Resolve.lean`,
  not `flattenConjDefRef`, so this slice owns `flattenConjDefRef` alone. Seed a `testdata/wild/` repro
  FIRST.

### PHASE A AUDIT (2026-07-12b, batch 3eeff2a..b73af4e) — 3 slices deep-audited

Batch verdict: all three slices SOUND. `buildFrame`/`canonicalFieldLayout` verified a faithful
mirror of `canonicalizeFields` (identical first-occurrence + `mergeFieldClass.isSome` keep/append
decision; `buildFrameFrom` reads only labels, so the label-at-index layout matches by construction
for every adversarial dup layout — dup+hidden-between, dup-of-def, dup+let-interleave, triple-dup,
dup+optional). `ownLiteralUnion` correct both directions (mixed own-literal+cross-def-ref and
disj-conjunct both fail `.all` → stay OPEN; pure own-literal union closes). `Value.patternLabel`
non-output marker confirmed leak-proof: `Manifest` → incomplete error, `meetCore` → ⊥,
`substPatternLabel` enumerates every carrier (no catch-all), residual patterns never manifest;
`Format` → bare name is the correct `cue eval` display of an unapplied residual. No Value-producing
catch-all swallows `patternLabel`. Two NEW findings:

- **RESOLVE-DEDUP-MIRROR-GUARD (MED, drift hazard — no regression today). ✅ LANDED 2026-07-12.**
  Structural hoist per Phase B's design: the duplicate-collapse DECISION now lives ONCE in
  `Lattice.mergeFieldLayoutInto` (parameterized over the value-merge `combine`). `canonicalizeFields`
  (EvalBase) folds it with `mergeUnevaluatedFieldValue` (definition-vs-`.conj`); `canonicalFieldLayout`
  (Resolve) folds it with identity-keep (`fun _ current _ => current`). `mergeUnevaluatedFieldInto`
  DELETED — its body was that specialization. Drift is now impossible by construction: resolve and eval
  index the SAME keep-or-append layout. `check.sh` fully green, ZERO fixtures/theorems flipped (proves the
  specialization is exact — a true behavior-preserving refactor). Belt-and-suspenders `native_decide`
  guard `canonical_layout_label_mirrors_canonicalize_fields` (ResolveTests) pins the label projection
  across a dup/dup-hidden/dup-of-def/triple-dup/dup-optional/class-mismatch battery. `buildFrame`'s
  collapse layout is now stabilized for LET-CYCLE-ERROR. Original filing:
- **~~RESOLVE-DEDUP-MIRROR-GUARD (superseded by the LANDED note above)~~.** `canonicalFieldLayout`
  (`Kue/Resolve.lean`) hand-copies the collapse decision of `canonicalizeFields`/`mergeUnevaluatedFieldInto`
  (`Kue/EvalBase.lean`). Resolve imports only `Value`+`Lattice` (not `EvalBase`, which pulls the whole eval
  stack), so it CANNOT reuse `canonicalizeFields` — hence the copy. The label-at-index equivalence holds
  now (verified by hand across all dup-layout variants), but is pinned by NOTHING except incidental
  behavioral fixtures: any future edit to `mergeUnevaluatedFieldInto`'s first-occurrence semantics silently
  drifts `canonicalFieldLayout` → dangling/misdirected refs in EVERY struct with duplicate fields. This is
  the exact "two mirrors, no gate" class the recurring-misalignments guard warns of (prose-only invariants
  rot; script/theorem-enforced ones hold). **Fix (RECOMMENDED — structural hoist, Phase-B-designed
  2026-07-12): single-source the collapse DECISION in `Lattice`, drift impossible by construction.** Both
  `Resolve` and `EvalBase` already import `Lattice`, where `mergeFieldClass` (the decision's only dependency)
  already lives — no cycle, natural home, no `Resolve → EvalBase` upward edge (which would pull the whole
  eval/stdlib stack into a lexical-scope pass). Extract the fold-step, parameterized over the value-merge so
  the eval side keeps its `mergeDefinitionDecls`/`joinUnevaluated` (EvalBase-level) and the resolve side
  passes a drop-combine:
  ```
  -- Lattice.lean (beside mergeFieldClass)
  def mergeFieldLayoutInto (combine : FieldClass → Field → Field → Field)
      (fields : List Field) (field : Field) : Option (List Field) :=
    match fields with
    | [] => some [field]                                   -- no same-label slot → append at end
    | current :: rest =>
        if current.label = field.label then
          match mergeFieldClass current.fieldClass field.fieldClass with
          | some fc => some (combine fc current field :: rest)  -- first label match, class merges → collapse
          | none    => none                                     -- class mismatch → append, STOP (first-label rule)
        else (mergeFieldLayoutInto combine rest field).map (current :: ·)
  ```
  Then `canonicalizeFields` (EvalBase) folds with a `combine` that recomputes value via the passed `fc`
  (`if fc.isDefinition then mergeDefinitionDecls … else joinUnevaluated …`); `canonicalFieldLayout` (Resolve)
  folds with `fun _ current _ => current` (layout only — drop the duplicate). `mergeUnevaluatedFieldInto` is
  DELETED (its body IS `mergeFieldLayoutInto` specialized). No can't-happen branch, no partial indexing,
  structural recursion on `rest` — clean. The keep/append decision now exists ONCE; resolve and eval cannot
  disagree on which slots exist. NOT implemented inline: a 3-module core-merge refactor feeding EVERY struct
  merge + the exact SELF-CONJ-CYCLE-INDIRECT dangling-ref class — its own test-first slice (add 2–3
  adversarial dup-layout fixtures + a `native_decide` `(canonicalFieldLayout fs).map Field.label ==
  (canonicalizeFields fs).map Field.label` as migration insurance, though construction already guarantees it).
  **Coordinate with LET-CYCLE-ERROR** (also edits `Resolve.buildFrame`'s frame model): land this FIRST so the
  let-vs-field distinction builds on the single-sourced collapse layout.

- **DEF-FLATTEN-CLOSEDNESS-DISJ ✅ LANDED (2026-07-13).** CONFIRMED real under-close, then fixed.
  `#X: {a:1} & ({b:2} | {c:3})`: a `.disj` conjunct is not `isUnionableDefValue`, so `ownLiteralUnion`
  failed and the def flattened OPEN — a use-site `#X & {d:4}` kept BOTH arms alive (kue: "ambiguous
  value"), and with a default arm (`*{b:2}`) SILENTLY exported `{a:1,b:2,d:4}` (confirmed leak; cue v0.16.1
  rejects `y.d`). **Fix** (`flattenConjDefRef`, `Kue/EvalBase.lean`): the gate admits a `.disj` whose every
  arm is `isUnionableDefValue` (`isClosableDisj`); the close branch DISTRIBUTES the def's own literal union
  across a single such disjunction and closes each arm as `closeLiteralUnion (literals ++ [arm])`, emitting
  `.disj [{a,b}(closed), {a,c}(closed)]`. Both-direction guards hold: a `...`-tail arm stays OPEN (union
  keeps openness); the default marker is preserved per arm. 4 wild fixtures
  (`def-flatten-closedness-disj{,-select,-default,-open-arm}`). The pure-literal path was refactored to
  share the same `closeLiteralUnion` helper (byte-identical). **Scoped-out (remaining, LOW):** (a) a
  disjunction arm that is a `.refId` / scalar is NOT closable this way, so `#X: {a:1} & ({b:2} | #Base)`
  stays OPEN (cue closes it — a remaining under-close); (b) MULTIPLE closable disjunctions (cross-product)
  stay OPEN; (c) a NESTED disjunction arm (`({b:2} | ({c:3}|{e:5}))`) is not `isUnionableDefValue` either,
  same class. **[RE-RANKED 2026-07-13 Phase A audit → HIGH, FILED as DEF-FLATTEN-CLOSEDNESS-DISJ-REF in the
  Ranked OPEN backlog. "Stays OPEN" understated it: the residual is a SILENT SOUNDNESS LEAK — when the
  open def resolves to a single concrete arm it exports fields past a closed def, no error. Same class as
  the default-leak this slice fixed, one shape over. See the backlog entry for repros.]** **[✅ ALL THREE
  RESIDUALS (a/b/c) LANDED 2026-07-13 — see DEF-FLATTEN-CLOSEDNESS-DISJ-REF ✅ FULLY LANDED above. `isClosableDisj`

### PHASE B AUDIT (2026-07-13d, HEAD post-`ca2c147`) — list-carrier completeness by construction + reconcile

Whole-graph pass after Phase A (`ca2c147`). Infra rotation NOT repeated (done 2026-07-12 Phase B).

**TASK 1 — LIST-CARRIER completeness, FIXED INLINE (recommended (a): single-classifier centralization).**
LIST-OPS-EMBEDDED-CARRIER is the recurring "hand-enumerate carriers, miss one" defect. Approaches
evaluated: (a) route every consumer through the one classifier `listItems?`; (b) collapse the three
carriers into one `list items (tail : Option) (decls)` — REJECTED: it shifts risk, not removes it (the
many sites that legitimately distinguish closed-plain / open / embedded — Manifest, indexing, meet — would
have to re-derive the distinction from `tail`/`decls`, trading "miss a carrier" for "mishandle
tail/decls"; the split is partly ESSENTIAL); (c) a `native_decide` exhaustiveness guard — dispreferred
(guard, not construction). **Chose (a), implemented inline.** All list-carrier reads in `Kue/Builtin.lean`
now route through `listItems?`: `listConcat`/`listFlattenFuel`/`lenValue`/`openListOperand` directly
(fuel/spine recursion). The filing claimed the full-flatten depth site FORCES a direct pattern arm
(structural subterm) — FALSIFIED: `listNestingDepth` DELETED, replaced by `listFlattenAll`, a WF recursion
through `listItems?` proven terminating by the new `sizeOf_listItems?_lt` lemma + `List.sizeOf_lt_of_mem`.
(A `sizeOf items` fuel bound was tried first — noncomputable, `List Value`'s SizeOf has no compiled form;
WF via the proof-level sizeOf is the fix.) Found + fixed TWO carrier-miss sites beyond the filing's three:
`lenValue` and `openListOperand` (the sole `list.*` operand normalizer — its miss broke EVERY `list.*`
builtin on an embedded-list operand). Result: a missed carrier is designed out (one classifier, N
consumers; a new carrier is one edit to `listItems?`). Seed GRADUATED + expanded to six facets; `check.sh`
green. Note: `listItems?` keeps its `| _ => none` — the repo's sanctioned Option-probe idiom (full
33-ctor enumeration is over-scaffolding the rule explicitly exempts); it is the single point to update.

**TASK 2 — the two-equalities boundary: DOCUMENTED, no misuse.** Three equality notions coexist, disjoint
domains: global derived `BEq Value` (exact/order/carrier-sensitive — cycle detection, memo keys),
`structuralEq` (value-based, open-tail-stripping — list/struct `==`, Contains, UniqueItems),
`eqUpToFieldOrder` (field-order-normal lattice identity — disjunct dedup). Each had a def-site comment but
no single boundary note; ADDED one to `architecture.md` § 3 ("three notions, do not add a fourth"). Grep
for raw `Value` `==`/dedup in the list/eval/lattice core found NO misuse — `list.Contains`/`UniqueItems`
route through `structuralEq`; the `.contains` hits are Char/String. Phase A's "boundary correct" verdict
holds.

**TASK 3 — graph health.** Layering clean (`Builtin ↛ Eval`, no cycles among Builtin/Eval/EvalBase/
Lattice/Normalize). No dead code (`String.dropRight`/`List.isEqv`/`sorry`/`admit`: none). All 4 non-Parse
`partial def` (Module.lean) waived. `| _ =>` catch-alls in Value-producing matches: the graph sweep
flagged several (EvalBase:368/754, Eval:257/1468, Normalize:34, Lattice error-bottom arms, Builtin
listMin/Max/mathAbs/Round `| _ => .bottom`, Manifest:112) — all PRE-EXISTING, matching on Prim/kind/enum
or defer-fallbacks that prior audits cleared; NOT re-filed (clean-is-clean, no manufacturing). Module
sizes: EvalBase 2724, CaseTable 2438 (generated Unicode data — expected), Parse 2409 (the parser —
expected). Only EvalBase is a genuine split candidate — PB-EVALBASE-SPLIT already filed. Perf-guide: two
"Known limitations (current)" bullets (hash O(N²), regex-linear) are actually RESOLVED/LANDED and mis-placed
— minor, filed PB-PERFGUIDE-STALE (LOW).

**Reconciled ranked HEAD** (philosophy: active soundness leak → LOW gaps → nav-debt → chakrit-gated float):
1. ~~**DEF-FLATTEN-CLOSEDNESS-DISJ-REF residual**~~ ✅ LANDED 2026-07-13 — the ref/scalar + nested arms
   closed WITHOUT the anticipated `resolveDisjArm` eval (non-struct picks open-compose unchanged; nested
   arms flatten-first). This was the LAST known HIGH silent soundness leak — **all known soundness leaks
   are now closed.**
2. **PATTERN-LABEL-ALIAS-SCALAR** / **UNREFERENCED-ALIAS** / **LIST-ISSORTED** (LOW correctness gaps —
   missing feature / validation / builtins). Cheap, parallel-safe.
3. **PB-PERFGUIDE-STALE** (LOW doc — move 2 resolved bullets out of "current limitations").
4. **PB-EVALBASE-SPLIT** (`EvalScan.lean` first) / **PB-FIXTUREPORTS-SPLIT** — MED nav-debt, cohesion filler.
5. **DEFERRED float FDLIBM campaign** (F5→F1→F3, chakrit's prioritization — not auto-scheduled).

**Phase-of-work recommendation.** All LIST-family soundness now CLOSED; DEF-FLATTEN-DISJ-REF is the single
remaining silent-wrong-value/leak, so it ranks first despite entanglement (it's the actual target —
correctness — not filler). If its `resolveDisjArm` spike proves too entangled for one slice, clear the LOW
gaps (item 2, quick wins) while decomposing it, rather than deferring to a probe. Hold float for chakrit's
explicit go.

### PHASE B AUDIT (2026-07-13b, HEAD `c3f6c01`, batch `8213870..c3f6c01`) — OrderedPrim fit + strategic reconcile

Whole-graph pass after the comparison-retype / interpolation-fix / OrderedPrim batch (BINARY-CMP-BYTES,
STRING-BYTES-PROBE, BOUND-ORDEREDPRIM). Infra rotation NOT repeated (done 2026-07-12 Phase B, several
cycles ago). **Reconciliation:** the last Phase B (`8213870`) recommended (c) a bytes/string probe and
queued BINARY-CMP-BYTES + BOUND-ORDEREDPRIM — ALL executed and LANDED (`3fd6616`/`e785c67` cmp,
`6c9fd69` probe, `7c8eedc`/`4e469ac` OrderedPrim). The entire queued head from the last two Phase Bs is
now cleared. Graph HEALTHY: acyclic, `Builtin ↛ Eval`, `Lattice`/`Order` import only
`Value`/`Regex`/`StringFormat` (low); no `Value`-producing `| _ =>` (Value.lean catch-alls all
Option/Bool/List probes); EvalBase 2663 (+5 from 2658 — the batch was Value/Lattice/EvalOps/Parse, NOT
EvalBase, so PB-EVALBASE-SPLIT is NOT nearer due).

- **`OrderedPrim` architectural fit — CORRECT, no tightening owed.** Placed right (clustered with
  `Prim`/`NumberDomain`/`BoundKind`/`boundConstraint` in `Value.lean`). The `Prim`/`OrderedPrim` carrier
  overlap (int/float/string/bytes in both) is NOT duplication — `OrderedPrim` is a genuine **refinement**
  (ordered subset, excludes null/bool; folds `NumberDomain` into the numeric arms only), and carrier
  overlap is inherent to a Lean refinement type with no subtyping. The refinement/forgetful pair
  `ofPrim?`/`toPrim` is the single trust boundary; the invariant (no null/bool operand, no domain-bearing
  string/bytes bound) is now structural. This is the illegal-states-unrepresentable win, not debt.
- **PB-ORDEREDPRIM-COMPARE (VERY LOW, optional — marginal DRY, NOT an illegal-states win). OPEN.** The 5
  bound-layer compare sites (`tightenSameSide`/`rangeFeasible`/`meetTwoBounds` ×2 + join canonical-order,
  all in `Lattice`) do `.toPrim` then `primOrdCompare?`. A thin `OrderedPrim.compare? (l r) := primOrdCompare?
  l.toPrim r.toPrim` would dedup the `.toPrim` and narrow the `none` meaning to family-mismatch-only at the
  bound boundary. **`primOrdCompare?` itself STAYS `Prim`-typed** — the binary `<`/`<=` path
  (`evalPrimitiveOrdering`) genuinely compares arbitrary prims incl. null/bool and RELIES on `none ⇒ ⊥`;
  retyping it to `OrderedPrim` there is a category error (comparison, not bound-building). So this is a
  marginal wrapper, not a structural tightening (`none` still exists) — file below the LOW tail, do NOT
  prioritize. There is NO other latent ordered-only-invariant site to migrate: the binary-comparison path
  is arbitrary-operand by design, not a guarded ordered-only invariant.
- **PB-MKFLOATBOUND-WAIVER (LOW cosmetic — convention drift). OPEN.** `mkFloatBound` (`Value.lean:473`) is
  test-only (core builds float bounds via `OrderedPrim.ofPrim?` on an evaluated prim; only `Kue/Tests/*`
  call it) but lacks the AUD-B4-style test-support-in-core waiver comment its sibling `textBytes` carries —
  a future false-positive dead-code-deletion hazard. Add the one-line waiver; BATCH it with the next slice
  that already touches `Value.lean` (a comment-only edit to a leaf module forces a full rebuild — not worth
  a dedicated cut).

**Reconciled ranked HEAD (all soundness clusters CLOSED, NO active wrong-value bugs, bound-operand type
fully tightened — philosophy: spec-COMPLETENESS now leads, no correctness debt outstanding):**
1. **Float feature-completion — F1 (`math.Log1p`/`Expm1`) → F3 (trig) → F5 (template-float/`Float64bits`)
   [RECOMMENDED next phase].** Real stdlib surface currently `unsupportedBuiltin`; the F2 IEEE `BinFloat`
   kernel is LANDED and its SOLE justification was to unblock these — leaving it unwired is a half-finished
   seam. F1 is small and exercises the kernel end-to-end (validates the F2 investment). See § "Phase-of-work"
   below for the float-vs-probe reasoning.
2. **PATTERN-LABEL-ALIAS-SCALAR** / **UNREFERENCED-ALIAS** (LOW correctness gaps). (DEF-FLATTEN-CLOSEDNESS-DISJ
   ✅ LANDED 2026-07-13; the ref-arm / multi-disj tail stays as an optional LOW follow-up.)
3. **PB-EVALBASE-SPLIT** (`EvalScan.lean` first) / **PB-FIXTUREPORTS-SPLIT** — MED nav-debt, cohesion filler.
4. **LOW tail:** PA-ESC-2/SUB-4/TT-5, PB-VERSION-CONST/CHECK-COMMENT/FOLD-PLACEMENT/PRIM-CATCHALL/RELEASE-3/
   TESTORG-4, + new PB-ORDEREDPRIM-COMPARE / PB-MKFLOATBOUND-WAIVER.

**Phase-of-work recommendation → (a) FLOAT feature-completion, NOT another probe.** Rationale: (1) with
NO active wrong-value bugs and all soundness clusters closed, completeness (closing `unsupportedBuiltin`
holes) is the more concrete goal-advancing path than speculative probing — the stated goal is correctness
+ completeness across the WHOLE stdlib surface. (2) Probe yield is DECLINING as core surfaces saturate:
SCOPING (07-12) = 4 defects, bytes/string (07-13) = 1 corner defect. The heavily-measured value-semantics
surfaces (structs, disjunctions, comprehensions, closedness, scoping, operand-typing, bytes/string,
structural-cycles) are largely pinned. (3) The F2 kernel is landed leverage sitting idle — F1 wires it for
~1 slice. **Fork note (resolve by leverage, do NOT stop to ask):** if a probe IS preferred, the
least-measured surface is list-operations detail (slicing/concat/comprehension interplay) or field-modality
composition (`?`/`!`/`_`/dynamic) — NOT bytes/string (just probed), disjunction/default (swept 07-04), or
number-formatting/precision (F-series saturated). But float is higher-yield: concrete, unblocked, currently
erroring.

### PHASE B AUDIT (2026-07-13, HEAD `42e5fad`, batch `6b781a8..728c930`) — new cycle/frame family placement + reconcile

Whole-graph pass after the reference-cycle→top batch (SELF-SELECT-CYCLE-CROSSFRAME, RESOLVE-DEDUP-
MIRROR-GUARD, LET-CYCLE-ERROR). Infra rotation NOT repeated (done at the 2026-07-12 Phase B block).
Reconciliation: every OPEN item from the last Phase B (`290817b`) re-checked against HEAD — BINARY-CMP-
BYTES, BOUND-ORDEREDPRIM, PATTERN-LABEL-ALIAS-SCALAR, UNREFERENCED-ALIAS, DEF-FLATTEN-CLOSEDNESS-DISJ,
PA-ESC-2/SUB-4/TT-5, PB-VERSION-CONST/CHECK-COMMENT/FOLD-PLACEMENT/PRIM-CATCHALL/RELEASE-3/TESTORG-4,
PB-EVALBASE-SPLIT, PB-FIXTUREPORTS-SPLIT all still unlanded, correctly ranked. Phase A (`42e5fad`)
already struck the landed LET-CYCLE-ERROR from the ranked head. Graph HEALTHY: acyclic, `Builtin ↛ Eval`,
`Resolve`/`Lattice` stay low; no new dead code; no `Value`-producing `| _ =>` in the new surface.

- **New cycle/frame helper family — placement CORRECT, do NOT extract.** The batch added two clusters,
  each placed with its natural kin, NOT scattered:
  - `cycleSlots`/`allLetCycle` (EvalBase L52–64) sit immediately beside the existing `slotVisited`
    cycle-guard primitive (L41). Tiny (5–8 lines), tightly coupled to the reference-cycle guard. Correct.
  - `structFrameLayout?`/`frameDepthOfId`/`enclosingSelfSelectId?`/`selectChainId?` (L2071–2129) are
    frame-identity self-select resolvers, placed beside the `thisStructFieldIndex?` select-resolution
    family. They depend HARD on EvalBase's frame layer — `canonicalizeFields`, `lazyConjMergedFields`,
    `Env`/`Frame`/`FrameKey`, the `pushFrame` frame table. A `CycleDetection`/`FrameId` leaf is NOT a
    clean extraction: it would drag the entire frame layer out with them (not a leaf). RULED: keep in
    EvalBase. This does NOT change PB-EVALBASE-SPLIT's seam — the frame-select helpers cannot leave
    without the frame layer, so `EvalScan.lean` (the `foldValueWithDepth` scanner mutual, L92–175) is
    STILL the natural first extraction, unchanged by this batch. The cycle-helper family is NOT the
    EvalBase relief.
- **`mergeFieldLayoutInto` in `Lattice` — RIGHT HOME.** It centralizes the field-collapse decision that
  lives with `mergeFieldClass` (also `Lattice`); both callers (Resolve, EvalBase) already import Lattice,
  no cycle. Confirmed by the RESOLVE-DEDUP design. Correct.
- **New `BottomReason.letClauseCycle`/`ManifestError.letClauseCycle` — modeled CONSISTENTLY.**
  `BottomReason.letClauseCycle (label) (isMutual)` sits beside `structuralCycle`, structured payload,
  the self-vs-mutual distinction carried as a clean 2-state `Bool` (not a stringly-typed message);
  `ManifestError.letClauseCycle` mirrors `unsupportedBuiltinFunction` (specific error → cue-shaped CLI
  message). No loose-type drift.
- **EvalBase size:** 2658 (was 2587 at last Phase B; +71 from these 3 slices). Still NOT gate-forced
  (no core-module size gate). PB-EVALBASE-SPLIT unchanged: MED nav-debt, `EvalScan.lean` first, behind
  correctness. PB-FIXTUREPORTS-SPLIT (4237, registration-exempt) unchanged.

**Reconciled ranked HEAD (philosophy: active wrong-value → type-tightening → LOW gaps → feature → nav-debt):**
1. ~~**BINARY-CMP-BYTES**~~ ✅ LANDED `3fd6616` — bytes ordered comparison routed through
   `primOrdCompare?`; the LAST active wrong-value bug, now CLOSED. No active wrong-value bugs remain.
2. **BOUND-ORDEREDPRIM** (LOW, illegal-states — ~60-site `OrderedPrim` retype, the `boundConstraint.domain`
   numeric-sentinel tightening). Type-system leverage; parallel-safe filler.
3. **PATTERN-LABEL-ALIAS-SCALAR** / **UNREFERENCED-ALIAS** (LOW correctness gaps — missing feature /
   missing validation). (DEF-FLATTEN-CLOSEDNESS-DISJ ✅ LANDED 2026-07-13.)
4. **Float F1** (unblocked by F2, small, exercises the `BinFloat` kernel end-to-end) → F3 → F5.
5. **PB-EVALBASE-SPLIT** (`EvalScan.lean`) / **PB-FIXTUREPORTS-SPLIT** — MED nav-debt, cohesion filler.

**Phase-of-work recommendation → (c) open a NEW conformance probe, bridged by BINARY-CMP-BYTES.** The
three soundness clusters (reference-cycle→top, operand-typing, flatten-closedness) are all CLOSED; the
remaining backlog is LOW cleanup + nav-debt + scoped float. Grinding the LOW backlog (option a) is the
lowest-EV path — none are wrong-value, and 3 no-movement slices trip the blind-grind circuit breaker.
Float F1/F3/F5 (option b) is real but narrow feature-completion, not the whole-surface-correctness goal.
The differential-probe method is the highest-yield bug SOURCE for the actual target (SCOPING-PROBE just
yielded 4 real defects, all now fixed). Sequence: land BINARY-CMP-BYTES first (active bug, ~1 slice,
already queued), then open a fresh probe on the **bytes/string value family** — the least-measured core
surface relative to structs/disjunctions/comprehensions, and the family BINARY-CMP-BYTES itself sits in
(comparison, ordering, concat, `len`, slicing, interpolation edges). Run BOUND-ORDEREDPRIM (tightening)
and float F1 as parallel-safe filler between probe slices. Escalation note: whether to probe bytes/string
vs list/slice vs field-modality (`?`/`!`/`_`/dynamic) is a philosophy-open next-leader fork — resolve by
leverage, do not stop to ask.

### PHASE B AUDIT (2026-07-12c, HEAD `290817b`) — mirror-guard design + split seams + ranked head

Module-graph + design cycle following Phase A `290817b` (infra rotation NOT repeated — done at the
2026-07-12 Phase B block below, 3 slices ago). Reconciliation: Phase A's two filings both verified
present + accurate (RESOLVE-DEDUP-MIRROR-GUARD, DEF-FLATTEN-CLOSEDNESS-DISJ); every older OPEN
(SELF-SELECT-CYCLE-CROSSFRAME, LET-CYCLE-ERROR, BINARY-CMP-BYTES, BOUND-ORDEREDPRIM,
PATTERN-LABEL-ALIAS-SCALAR, UNREFERENCED-ALIAS, PA-ESC-2/SUB-4/TT-5, PB-VERSION-CONST/CHECK-COMMENT/
FOLD-PLACEMENT/PRIM-CATCHALL/RELEASE-3/TESTORG-4, PB-EVALBASE-SPLIT, PB-FIXTUREPORTS-SPLIT) re-checked
against HEAD — all still unlanded, correctly ranked. No new dead code; no cycle; `Builtin ↛ Eval`
holds; `Resolve` stays `Value`+`Lattice`-only (the very reason the mirror exists).

- **RESOLVE-DEDUP-MIRROR-GUARD — DESIGNED (primary task).** Recommendation: **structural hoist over the
  `native_decide` guard.** The hoist eliminates drift BY CONSTRUCTION (single decision in `Lattice`, no
  cycle — both modules already import it and `mergeFieldClass` lives there); the theorem only pins a
  copy that still exists. Construction > test is Phase B's home turf. Concrete design (parameterized
  `mergeFieldLayoutInto` fold-step) folded into the filing above; NOT implemented inline (3-module
  core-merge refactor, own test-first slice). Sequence before LET-CYCLE-ERROR (shared `buildFrame`).
- **Module-graph: HEALTHY.** `Value.patternLabel`/`substPatternLabel` placement CORRECT — `substPatternLabel`
  in `Value.lean` (leaf); `patternLabel` modeled CONSISTENTLY with the `thisStruct` non-output marker
  family (Manifest routes both to `.error (.incomplete …)`, Format renders both, `substPatternLabel`
  enumerates every carrier with no `Value`-producing catch-all). No new loose-type-carrying-invariant
  candidate beyond the already-filed `boundConstraint.domain` sentinel (→ BOUND-ORDEREDPRIM).
- **Oversized modules (both re-assessed, refined above): NEITHER gate-forced.** `EvalBase` (2587) has no
  enforced core-module size gate; `FixturePorts` (4237) is registration-exempt from the 1800 test cap.
  Both are nav/cohesion debt with confirmed clean seams (PB-EVALBASE-SPLIT (a) `EvalScan.lean` first;
  PB-FIXTUREPORTS-SPLIT domain-mirror) — schedule behind correctness, never ahead.
- `| _ =>` ban: spot-checked the new pattern-alias surface (`Resolve.mapRefsValueWithFuel` fully
  enumerated, `substPatternLabel` no catch-all) — zero `Value`-producing violations. perf-guide: no new
  slow pattern surfaced this cycle; left as-is.

**Reconciled ranked HEAD (philosophy: active wrong-value correctness → construction-drift guards →
clean small bugs → tightening/refactor):**
1. ~~**SELF-SELECT-CYCLE-CROSSFRAME**~~ ✅ LANDED 2026-07-12 — reference-cycle→top class CLOSED across
   same-frame + indirect + cross-frame (+ nested chains).
2. ~~**RESOLVE-DEDUP-MIRROR-GUARD**~~ ✅ LANDED 2026-07-12 — collapse decision single-sourced in
   `Lattice.mergeFieldLayoutInto`; drift now impossible by construction; `buildFrame` layout stabilized.
3. ~~**LET-CYCLE-ERROR**~~ ✅ LANDED 2026-07-12 — pure-`let` reference cycles raise cue's load error
   (`reference "<name>" not found` self / `cyclic references in let clause or alias` mutual) on the
   single-sourced collapse layout; field-touching cycles keep `truncate .top`.
4. ~~**BINARY-CMP-BYTES**~~ ✅ LANDED 2026-07-13 — bytes ordered comparison via `primOrdCompare?`; the
   last active wrong-value bug CLOSED.
5. ~~**STRING-BYTES-PROBE**~~ ✅ LANDED 2026-07-13 — differential probe of the bytes/string value family
   (~40 cases vs cue v0.16.1). Corners now MEASURED: interpolation of every operand type, multiline
   `"""`/`'''` (indent/empty/interp/bytes), unicode `len` (counts BYTES), string slice/index (both ⊥),
   string↔bytes boundary (`bytes(x)`/`string(x)` not callable in cue), concat + `"ab"*3` repetition,
   bounds/regex/disj/default — all GREEN except ONE bug FIXED in-slice: a bytes value interpolated into
   a string literal (`"\(b)"`) deferred instead of rendering; bytes arm of `classifyInterpolationPart`
   now decodes valid UTF-8 (`testdata/wild/bytes-interp-into-string/`). Invalid-UTF-8 bytes defer
   (spec-gap `bytes-interp-invalid-utf8`); interpolation INSIDE a byte literal still tracked separately
   (`byte-literal-interpolation` seed). **A two-phase AUDIT is DUE next** (2 slices since last).
6. **BOUND-ORDEREDPRIM** (LOW illegal-states) — the ~60-site tightening; or a cohesion slice
   (PB-EVALBASE-SPLIT (a)) as parallel-safe filler.

### PHASE B AUDIT (2026-07-12, whole-graph + infra rotation) — module-graph + gates/release

**Infra rotation (3rd-cycle, folded in): gates + release tooling HEALTHY.** `check.sh` globs all 4
`check-*.sh` gates (`nullglob`), runs `lake build` + `shellcheck scripts/*.sh ./lake ./lean`; no
gate silently skipped. Every grep-based gate's targets still exist and its pattern still matches
(no rot): `check-comments.sh` history-idiom prohibition (0 hits = correct), `check-test-health.sh`
block-comment/tripwire/size gates, `check-fixtures.sh` hardcoded CLI-sample paths both present.
Wild-fixture auto-discovery (`check_wild_fixtures`, `*/` glob, 55 dirs) + `.known-red` three-state
quarantine (4 markers) intact; export/module/realworld globs reach all 7 `testdata/` dirs.
**RELEASE VERDICT: GO** — `scripts/release.sh <version>` traced end-to-end (version arg, clean-tree
precondition, arm64 build + shasum, tag push, `gh release create --generate-notes <asset>`,
`gh release upload --clobber` re-run path, `release-linux.sh` disjoint-block coordination,
`patch-formula-block.sh` url+sha256+version tap patch asserting exactly-one-hit) would succeed for an
autonomous alpha cut; no stale step. shellcheck covers all 9 `scripts/*.sh`.

- **PB-VERSION-CONST (LOW, release consistency). OPEN.** `kue version` reports the static constant
  `"0.1.0-alpha"` (`Kue/Runtime.lean:13`); `release.sh` does not bump it, so the shipped binary
  self-reports a version decoupled from the datestamped release tag (formula at
  `0.1.0-alpha.YYYYMMDD.N`). Not a release-script failure. Fix: have `release.sh` inject the version
  into the constant (or derive it) so the binary can self-identify its release.
- **PB-CHECK-COMMENT (COSMETIC). ✅ RESOLVED (2026-07-13 Phase B audit).** `scripts/check.sh` comment
  reworded from the post-DOCS-CLEANUP-stale "cert-manager canary" to the actual excluded live canary
  (`check-ghcr-live.lean`, needs a real registry).

**Module graph: clean DAG, no cycles/inversions** (`Regex` floor → `Value` → Decimal/Normalize/… →
Lattice → Builtin → EvalOps → EvalBase → EvalDefer → Eval → Runtime). `Builtin` does NOT import
`Eval` (intended low→high holds). `| _ =>` ban: swept ~200 occurrences, **zero Value/AST-producing
dispatch violations** — `canonicalizeBuiltinCalls` (Parse.lean:2130) is the enumerated exemplar; all
`_` arms are Bool/Option/List probes or fold leaves. `partial def` outside Parse.lean all carry
waiver comments (`Kue/Module.lean:251,698,734,767`). No `String.dropRight`/`takeRight`. Core
`Value`/`Field`/`Prim` types already strongly-typed (three-state `StructOpenness` with mkStruct
invariant); no high-leverage tightening candidate (`boundConstraint.domain` sentinel is documented,
marginal).

- **PB-EVALBASE-SPLIT (MEDIUM, module size — NOT gate-forced; nav/cohesion debt). OPEN.**
  `Kue/EvalBase.lean` (2587) is the largest non-generated module, but there is NO enforced size gate on
  core modules (the 1800-line gate is test-modules-only), so this is cohesion/navigation debt, not a due
  fix. **Seam CONFIRMED clean (Phase-B 2026-07-12, block boundaries re-verified):** (a) the
  `foldValueWithDepth` scanner mutual (`mutual` at L92–175) is a SEPARATE block from the core-force
  mutual — the natural first extraction to `Kue/EvalScan.lean` (imported-by-depth-only); (c) the
  `remapConjRefs` mutual (L481–630) + conjunct-flatten/splice + `defSlotInClosedCycle` (~1790–2211) is a
  second coherent unit. `canonicalizeFields` (L445) is standalone (folds into RESOLVE-DEDUP's
  `mergeFieldLayoutInto` first — sequence that before carving (c)). CAVEAT (durable ruling): the
  core-force `mutual` is NEVER split (its `termination_by` cannot cross a module boundary); (a) and (c)
  are separate blocks, so this carve buys headroom without touching it. Schedule as a cohesion slice; do
  NOT block correctness work on it.
- **PB-FOLD-PLACEMENT (LOW, cohesion). OPEN.** `valueMentionsSlotAtDepth` (EvalBase.lean:1844) is a
  scanner-family member sitting 1500 lines below the cluster AND hand-rolled rather than a
  `foldValueWithDepth` instantiation. Fold it into the shared fold (monoid `Bool`/`||`, `.refId` leaf
  — identical shape to `defFrameRefIndices`) and relocate beside the cluster. Note: the SELF-CONJ-
  CYCLE-INDIRECT fix may REMOVE this function entirely (it subsumes the `0091463` bail) — sequence
  after that fix; if removed, this finding is moot.
- **PB-PRIM-CATCHALL (LOW, hardening). OPEN.** `mathAbs`/`mathRound` (Builtin.lean:862,1035) and
  `listMin`/`listMax` (666,676) use `| _ => .bottom` on a `Prim`/`Option` match (not a `Value`
  dispatch, so not a strict ban violation) — a new numeric `Prim` constructor would be silently
  bottomed. Enumerate the `Prim` constructors to match house style.
- **PB-FIXTUREPORTS-SPLIT (MEDIUM, test-org — NOT gate-forced; registration-exempt). OPEN — distinct
  from PB-TESTORG-4.** `Kue/Tests/FixturePorts.lean` (4237, ~2.5× the next-largest test module) is the
  manual fixture-port harness, EXEMPT from the 1800-line test-module cap (mechanical registration, prior
  audit L531), so this is pure navigation debt, not a due fix. **Seam:** split by fixture domain
  mirroring the `*Tests.lean` topic split (each `registerFixture` cluster → a sibling
  `FixturePorts<Domain>.lean`, re-aggregated in `Tests.lean`); no logic moves, verbatim relocation.
  Pair with PB-TESTORG-4 (`BuiltinTests.lean` 1669) as ONE test-org pass. Low risk (registration only),
  but low value — schedule when a test-org pass is otherwise due, not ahead of correctness.

`testdata/` layout tidy (cue 11 / export 144 / modules 72 / ocifetch 5 / wild 56 / zip 2 / realworld
1); `realworld/` single-entry is intentional (CLAUDE.md: no real-world corpus is a target).

### COMPREHENSION/EMBEDDING/PATTERN CONFORMANCE PROBE (2026-07-04) — area clean, one parser gap seeded

Bounded divergence hunt over `for`/`if`/`let` comprehensions, struct embedding, and pattern
constraints (`[expr]: T`). Area is **spec-conformant** at the VALUE level across the whole
matrix — the only real divergence is a parser-completeness gap (below). Confirmed CONFORMANT
(kue == cue, spec-correct): `for k,v` over struct (skips hidden/optional/def members), `for
i,x` over list, value-only `for`, nested/multi-clause `for`, `let`-clause + `if`-guard,
empty-source (no fields), `for`/`if` producing struct fields dynamically; embed struct+sibling,
embed scalar/string/list carrier, embed def/ref, embed comprehension/conditional, embed
conflict → ⊥; pattern applied to added fields, regex-keyed, multi-pattern overlap, pattern +
explicit field (explicit must satisfy pattern → ⊥ on violation), pattern + `...` tail, pattern
excludes hidden/def fields, pattern via unification, dynamic field matched by pattern. Guard
theorems: `ComprehensionTests` `listcomp_for_kv_skips_nonregular`/`structcomp_for_produces_fields`;
`StructTests` `pattern_via_unification_constrains_added_field`/`pattern_explicit_field_must_satisfy`/
`pattern_matches_dynamic_field`.

- **PATTERN-BOUND-REF-OPERAND ✅ LANDED 2026-07-12 (PATTERN-BOUND-OPERAND) — both facets graduated.**
  Comparator bounds now apply to ANY ordered type, and non-literal operands defer+lower.
  `boundConstraint`'s operand generalized `DecimalValue → Prim` (number/string/bytes); one total
  `primOrdCompare?` + `BoundKind.admitsPrim?` drive every bound comparison (numeric decimal,
  string lexical by code point, bytes by byte order); meet/order/format/join all route through it.
  `string & <"m"` drops the redundant kind, `int & <"m"` and `>5 & >"m"` conflict, `<"m" & !="a"`
  and `=~"^a" & <"m"` conjoin — all byte-parity with cue v0.16.1. **Facet 2 (reference/expression
  operands):** `UnaryOp` gained `boundOp`/`neOp`/`regexMatchOp`; the parser emits a deferred
  `.unary` node for a non-literal operand (`>k`, `{[=~_re]: int}`, `<len(x)`), which `evalUnary`
  lowers to the concrete validator once the operand is ground (per CUE grammar
  `unary_op = … | rel_op`). Both seeds `testdata/wild/pattern-bound-{string,reference}-operand/`
  GRADUATED (`.known-red` removed). Theorems: `BoundTests` (string/bytes/tighten/notPrim/regex/
  kind-drop/type-mismatch/cross-family/format/numeric-regression) + `EvalOpsTests` deferred-
  lowering section. NOT a cue-divergence (cue was spec-correct); a kue completeness bug, now fixed.
  Probe otherwise found the pattern-constraint surface CONFORMING: regex label
  filtering, overlapping-pattern constraint intersection (incl. comparator-bound values),
  recursive patterns, unification-introduced patterns, disjunction-valued patterns all
  byte-identical to cue — now MEASURED + pinned (`testdata/export/pattern_constraints.{cue,json}`
  + `ClosednessTests` pattern-constraint conformance probe section).
- **Embed/comprehension field ORDER — already-ratified spec gap, NOT re-filed.** `{ {a:1}, b:2 }`
  → kue `{b,a}` (declaration order, embeddings after regular fields), cue `{a,b}`. This is
  "Field order #3" (RATIFIED): spec declares structs unordered, cue's
  order is "an undocumented internal-graph artifact"; parity DECLINED, Kue keeps source order.
  the jq `-S` export gate is order-insensitive. Recognized + skipped per probe instructions.

### NUMERIC/BUILTIN CONFORMANCE PROBE (2026-07-04) — one bug fixed, follow-ups filed

Bounded divergence hunt over numeric literals/formatting/arithmetic + a stdlib-builtin
sampling. Confirmed CONFORMANT (kue == cue, spec-correct): `0.1+0.2`, `1.0/3.0` (34-digit),
huge bignum int literals + arithmetic, int-vs-float unification rejection, all numeric
bounds (`>=0 & <=10 & 5`, `>3 & int`, conflicting → bottom, `>=1.5 & int`), `math.Round`/
`Floor`/`Ceil`/`Trunc` incl. negatives + `.5`, `div`/`mod`/`quo`/`rem` sign behavior,
`len(string)` (bytes: ascii/multibyte/emoji), `strings.Join`/`Split`/`ToUpper`/`TrimSpace`/
`Replace`/`Contains`, `list.Concat`/`Range`/`Sort`/`FlattenN`.

- **FLOAT-UNIFY-EQUAL (semantic bug) — FIXED this slice.** `meetPrim` compared `Prim`
  structurally, so unifying two floats equal-in-value but distinct-in-string (`1.0 & 1.00`,
  `0.10 & 0.1`, `100.0 & 1e2`, `1.5 & 1.50`) bottomed — contradicting kue's own `==` (which
  returns `true`). `primsUnifyEqual` now compares float-vs-float by exact base-10 value
  (`parseDecimalText`+`decimalEqValues`), keeping the LEFT operand (cue's rule); other kinds
  stay structural; int-vs-float stays a type conflict. Wild fixture
  `float-unify-equal-diff-representation` (enforced) + `NumberTests` `meet_prim_float_*`.
- **GDA-FLOAT-RENDER ✅ LANDED 2026-07-05.** Floats now render through CUE's canonical GDA
  `to-scientific-string` per output surface via `renderFloatText` (`Value.lean`), replacing
  verbatim `text` emission in `Format`/`Json`/`Yaml`. Byte-identical to `cue` v0.16.1 across
  JSON (uppercase `E`, bare whole floats), YAML (uppercase `E`, `.` whole floats), and
  cue-native (lowercase `e`, `.0` whole floats) on the full matrix: small-exp expansion
  (`1e-2`→`0.01`, `12345e-2`→`123.45`), large-magnitude scientific (`1e40`→`1E+40`),
  plain/scientific boundary at adjusted-exp `≥ −6` (`1e-6`→`0.000001`, `1e-7`→`1E-7`),
  representation collapse (`1.00e2`→`100`/`100.0`), `-0.0`→`0.0`. **Plan's original mechanism
  was FALSE and is superseded:** "render on the exact `DecimalValue`" cannot work — a
  normalized `DecimalValue` (non-negative `scale`) multiplies a positive exponent into the
  coefficient, so `1e2` and `1.00e2` share `{100,0}` yet must render `1E+2` vs `100`, and
  `1e40`→`{10^40,0}` would render PLAIN not scientific. The apd `(coefficient, exponent)` form
  is reconstructed from the retained `text` instead (the round-trip anchor 0e kept). Recorded
  in `cue-spec-gaps.md` (FLOAT OUTPUT FORM — spec-silent, kue matches cue). Retraction: the
  original bullet's claim that "arithmetic sign-of-zero (`0.0 * -1`→cue `-0.0`)" is a target to
  match is WRONG — `cue` export does NOT uniformly normalize zeros (it exports `-0.0` for that
  arithmetic case); kue normalizes ALL rendered zeros to `0.0` (lattice-consistency: `-0.0 ==
  0.0`), matching cue on the literal `-0.0`→`0.0` and diverging on the arithmetic case,
  recorded in `cue-divergences.md`. Fixtures: `testdata/export/float_render_gda.*`,
  `testdata/cue/numeric/float_gda_render.expected`; `FloatTests` GDA section (4 theorems).
- **STRINGS-RUNES-MISSING — DONE (2026-07-04).** `strings.Runes(s)` now registered:
  `stringRunes` maps each `Char` (Unicode scalar) to `.prim (.int codepoint)`, so
  multibyte/astral are one int per rune (`"a😀b"`→`[97,128512,98]`), astral-correct (full
  code point, not surrogate halves/bytes). Dispatch arm in `evalStringsBuiltin`; wrong-arity
  / non-string falls through to `unresolvedOrBottom` (concrete ⇒ bottom, matching cue's
  error). Fixture `strings_runes` (ascii/multibyte/emoji/empty/combining) + 6 `native_decide`
  theorems. kue == cue v0.16.1 on all cases.
- **BI-3-STDLIB-PROBE — DONE (2026-07-04).** Conformance probe of the deeper stdlib +
  type/kind ops (registered-builtin sweep + language meets). **Registered & implemented this
  slice** (all unregistered gaps, kue previously bottomed, cue succeeds — kue == cue v0.16.1):
  `list.Reverse`; `strings.LastIndex` (byte index of last occurrence, empty needle ⇒ byte
  length), `strings.Compare` (byte-lexicographic −1/0/1), `strings.Trim`/`TrimLeft`/`TrimRight`
  (cutset is a rune SET, not a prefix), `strings.TrimPrefix`/`TrimSuffix` (single fixed affix).
  Helpers `listReverse`/`stringLastByteIndex`/`byteSeqCompare`/`stringCompare`/`stringTrim*` in
  `Builtin.lean`, dispatch arms in `evalListBuiltin`/`evalStringsBuiltin` (wrong shape ⇒
  `unresolvedOrBottom`). Fixtures `strings_trim`, `strings_compare`, `list_reverse` + 10
  `native_decide` (`BuiltinTests.lean`). **Type/kind meet ops SWEPT CLEAN** (no code change): `int
  & number`→int, `1 & number`→1, `1.5 & int`→⊥, `1 & float`→⊥, `"x" & bytes`→⊥, `null & int`→⊥,
  `_ & 5`→5, `>5 & int & <10 & 7`→7, `(int|string) & 5`→5, `>5 & <3`→⊥ — all agree with cue
  (verdict + concrete value); 2 guard theorems pin the family. Also-conformant (both error, only
  message text differs): all negative/oob/empty-list arg errors on `list.Take`/`Slice`/`Repeat`/
  `Range(zerostep)`/`Min`/`Avg`, `strings.Repeat(neg)`. **cue-non-functions confirmed** (kue
  bottom is correct — these are NOT functions in cue v0.16.1): `strings.Title`/`PadLeft`/`PadRight`,
  `math.GreatestCommonDivisor`, `math.MaxInt64` (undefined field). Real-world gate EMPTY.
- **BI-3-RESIDUAL (bounded subset DONE 2026-07-04; validators + byte-repr still FILED).**
  **Registered & implemented this slice** (kue == cue v0.16.1 on the agreeing cases): `math.Mod`
  (Go float-remainder, sign of dividend, exact-decimal `x − trunc(x/y)·y`; `Mod(x,0)` ⇒ bottom;
  DIVERGES from cue's float64 on non-float64-exact remainders — `Mod(5.5,2.1)`=`1.3` vs cue
  `1.2999…998`, recorded in `cue-divergences.md`), `math.Signbit` (true iff `numerator<0`;
  `Signbit(-0.0)`=false, matching cue's parse-time `-0.0`→`0.0`), `strings.SliceRunes` (half-open
  rune-indexed window on `Char` scalars; oob/neg/`lo>hi` ⇒ bottom). Helpers `mathMod`/`mathSignbit`/
  `stringSliceRunes` in `Builtin.lean`, dispatch arms in `evalMathBuiltin`/`evalStringsBuiltin`.
  Fixtures `builtins/math_mod_signbit`, `builtins/strings_slicerunes` + 21 `native_decide`
  (`BuiltinTests.lean`). **`strings.MinRunes`/`MaxRunes` + `list.MinItems`/`MaxItems`/`UniqueItems`
  LANDED (STDLIB-VALIDATORS, 2026-07-11)** — NOT via the `.builtinCall`-in-`meet` seam this item
  posited, but by GENERALIZING the `struct.MinFields`/`MaxFields` validator: `fieldCountConstraint`
  became `Value.lengthConstraint (kind : LengthKind) (bound) (limit)` (`kind` ∈ `fields`/`listItems`/
  `runes` — "count a measurable and bound it"), plus a sibling `Value.uniqueItems` predicate
  validator. Both participate in `meet` directly (`applyLengthConstraint`/`applyUniqueItems`,
  `Lattice.lean`); a closed list / concrete string decides at meet, a struct / open list / abstract
  string retains and finalizes at manifest (`finalizeLengthConj`). UniqueItems equality is
  field-order-independent (`eqUpToFieldOrder`); a positive GROUND dup bottoms eagerly. Runes =
  Unicode code points, NOT bytes. Fixture `export/list_string_validators` + ~40 `native_decide`
  (`FixtureTests.lean`).
  - **Phase-A audit HIGH-1/HIGH-2 — RESOLVED (STDLIB-VALIDATORS-SOUND, 2026-07-11).** The audit
    found two silently-wrong-concrete-result soundness bugs sharing one root cause: eager
    meet/finalization decisions sound only on GROUND values fired on ABSTRACT values that merely
    looked decided. HIGH-1: an abstract string's length is now `LengthMeasure.unknown` (not a
    fabricated `lowerBound 0`), so `string & MinRunes(n)` retains as incomplete rather than
    bottoming, and the disjunction arm `(string & MinRunes(5)) | "hi"` no longer collapses to a
    fabricated `"hi"`. HIGH-2: `hasStructuralDup` → `hasGroundDup` (gated on the new total
    `Value.isGround`) so `[int,int] & UniqueItems` retains rather than eager-bottoming; genuine
    ground dups (`[1,1]`, `[{a:1},{a:1}]`) still bottom. Wild fixtures `minrunes-abstract-incomplete`
    / `minrunes-disj-arm-fabricated` / `uniqueitems-abstract-elements` /
    `uniqueitems-abstract-incomplete` + `FixtureTests` `minrunes_abstract_*` / `uniqueitems_abstract_*`.
    Two `cue-divergences.md` rows added (cue export's own abstract-UniqueItems fabrication; disj
    render delta).
  - Also still filed:
  `strings.ByteAt`/`ByteSlice` (~~need byte-array-repr, DEPENDENT of BYTE-ARRAY-REPR~~ — **LANDED
  STDLIB-STRINGS-LEAVES, 2026-07-11**; `Prim.bytes` already existed, no new repr needed),
  `list.IsSorted`/`Sort`/`SortStable` (comparator-struct `list.Ascending`/`Descending` — the
  effectful-builtin seam BI-EFF; kue leaves these an incomplete residual today —
  `list.IsSorted` DEFERRED again this slice: the `list.Ascending` comparator arg is the BI-EFF
  corner, out of scope for a bare-validator slice). SEPARATE
  (deferred exp/ln increment, needs decimal `exp`/`ln` to 34 digits — see BI-2-residual /
  cue-spec-gaps): `math.Log`/`Log10`/`Exp`, general fractional/negative `math.Pow` exponent, and
  the `math.Pi` constant (cue ships a 64-digit literal). None soundness-bearing; kue bottoms
  rather than emit a wrong value. **[Retraction 2026-07-11: LANDED as STDLIB-FLOAT F0 — the
  `math.Log`/`Log2`/`Log10`/`Exp`/`Exp2` family + all 11 constants are wired byte-identical to
  cue; the general/negative `math.Pow` exponent already landed via `decimalPowGeneral`. See the
  float-campaign roadmap below.]**
- **LIST-SLICE-MISSING (feature gap) — DONE (2026-07-04).** List slicing `x[lo:hi]` now
  parses as a postfix form alongside indexing `x[i]` and desugars to `list.Slice` (parser
  branch in `parseSelectorRest` + `parseSliceRest`, `Kue/Parse.lean`). Bounds are optional
  (omitted low = `0`, omitted high = `len(base)`). Semantics inherited from the existing
  `listSlice` + builtin-defer machinery: list-only operand, half-open 0-based; oob-high /
  negative / `lo>hi` → bottom; string operand → bottom; incomplete bound → residual defer.
  kue == cue v0.16.1 across the matrix (real-world gate empty). Fixture `list_slice` + 14
  `native_decide` (`SliceTests.lean`). Follow-up: BYTES-SLICE-MISSING (below).
- **BYTES-SLICE-MISSING (feature gap; FILE, not a bug — DEPENDENT of BYTE-ARRAY-REPR rank 0f; repr
  prerequisite MET 2026-07-05, impl still open — the `Array UInt8` carrier makes the slice a clean
  `Array.extract`).** cue slices bytes too
  (`'hello'[1:3]` → `'el'`, base64 `ZWw=`), byte-indexed; kue bottoms (the `list.Slice`
  desugar is list-only). Deferred deliberately from LIST-SLICE: reusing `list.Slice` for
  bytes would wrongly make the user-facing `list.Slice('bytes',…)` succeed, and a clean fix
  needs its own slice dispatch (an internal `__slice`/slice-family builtin handling both
  list and bytes) — a separate slice with its own byte-indexed fixtures. Tracked here as an
  unimplemented direction (cue is spec-correct on bytes slicing; not a divergence).

- **INTERP-OPERAND-TYPING (bug) — DONE (2026-07-04).** A string interpolation `"\(x)"` with a
  CONCRETE operand of a forbidden type now bottoms instead of passthrough-rendering. Probe (2026-07-04
  string-interpolation/regexp/encoding sweep) found `"\(null)"`→`"null"`, `"\([1,2])"`→literal
  `"\([1,2])"`, `"\({b:1})"`→literal `"\({b:1})"` — all kue-wrong; spec restricts an interpolation
  operand to `bool|string|bytes|number`. Fix: `classifyInterpolationPart` (total, all-ctor
  enumeration, mirrors `classifyDynLabel`) + `combineInterpVerdict` fold in `EvalBase.lean`, new
  `BottomReason.nonInterpolatable`. Concrete scalars still render; UNRESOLVED operands (ref/kind/
  bound/disj) still DEFER (no false errors — real-world gate EMPTY). Fixture
  `numeric/interpolation_type_error` + 8 `native_decide` (`Tests.lean`).
- **BYTE-LITERAL-LEXING (bug; escape half DONE 2026-07-04; interpolation DEFERRED).** Escape
  decoding FIXED: `decodeByteEscape` + `parseQuotedByteBody` in `Parse.lean` decode `\xNN` (hex
  byte), `\NNN` (exactly-three-digit octal), `\uNNNN`/`\UNNNNNNNN` (unicode → UTF-8), and
  `\a\b\f\n\r\t\v\\\'\"`. Graduated `byte-literal-hex-escape` (`'\x01ab'` → `AWFi`); added
  `byte-literal-octal-escape` (`QUJD`), `numeric/byte_literal_escapes` (eval fixture + FixturePort),
  8 `native_decide` (`BytesTests.lean`). Base64 JSON export already worked (`Json.lean`). ~~KNOWN
  LIMITATION: bytes are String-backed, so `\xNN`/`\NNN` ≥ 0x80 decode to that codepoint's two-byte
  UTF-8 form~~ — RETRACTED 2026-07-05 by BYTE-ARRAY-REPR (rank 0f): the `Array UInt8` carrier holds
  `\xNN`/`\NNN` ≥ 0x80 as a single raw byte; `BytesTests.lean` now pins the high-byte round-trip.
  Byte-context interpolation
  DEFERRED — seed `byte-literal-interpolation` STAYS `.known-red`: it needs a distinct byte-
  interpolation carrier (`.interpolation` renders to a STRING, no byte-context marker) — a new
  `Value`-producing arm rippling ~20 match sites + digest/format/manifest, disproportionate to
  bundle; `\(` falls through to a literal `(` (`(1)` → `KDEp`), red preserved. Follow-up slice
  **BYTE-INTERPOLATION**: ~~byte-array bytes repr (fixes ≥ 0x80, graduates the `byte-literal-high-byte`
  red seed)~~ (DONE 2026-07-05 in BYTE-ARRAY-REPR rank 0f) + byte-context interpolation carrier
  (graduates the `byte-literal-interpolation` seed +
  string-context bytes operand `"\(bytesval)"`, currently DEFERRED/safe).
  **RE-SCOPED (2026-07-04 Phase B): the byte-array repr half is now BYTE-ARRAY-REPR (rank 0f), which
  CLOSES BYTE-HIGHBYTE (fold that seed's graduation into 0f). BYTE-INTERPOLATION remains the residual
  byte-context-carrier follow-up, a DEPENDENT that lands after 0f — the carrier plumbing (~20 sites)
  is its own cost, not unlocked by the repr alone.**
  Related:
  bytes-operand render into a STRING interpolation (`"\(bytesval)"`) is also unimplemented — kue
  DEFERS it (safe), cue renders the UTF-8 form (`"ab"`); fold into the same slice.
- **BUILTIN-IMPORT-LENIENCY — ✅ LANDED 2026-07-05.** A package-qualified stdlib builtin
  reference (call `strings.ToUpper(...)` or constant `list.Ascending`) now resolves ONLY when its
  package is imported; an un-imported reference is `reference "<pkg>" not found` (bottom), matching
  cue v0.16.1. Enforced in the import-aware post-parse pass (`applyBuiltinAliases` →
  `canonicalizeBuiltinCalls`/`gateBuiltinImport`/`resolveBuiltinConstSelector`, `Kue/Parse.lean`),
  the single choke point both single-file (`parseDocument`) and module-load (`parseDocumentFile`)
  parses pass through. The slice operator `x[lo:hi]` desugars to a NEW core `slice` builtin —
  import-exempt (a language operator) and distinct from the import-gated public `list.Slice`.
  Corpus needed zero fixture migration (all 28 builtin-using fixtures already imported, being
  cue-oracle-derived); tests in `ImportEnforcementTests.lean`.
- **UNUSED-IMPORT — ✅ LANDED 2026-07-05 (sibling of BUILTIN-IMPORT-LENIENCY).** The mirror
  half: an `import` present but never referenced in the file body is now cue's `imported and
  not used` build error, so the document bottoms (`.importedNotUsed`). Enforced in `resolveImports`
  (`Kue/Parse.lean`, both parse entry points) via a pre-canonicalization `collectReferencedHeads`
  walk that gathers every referenced package head and checks each import's local bind name against
  it; detection only under-reports so a used import is never mis-flagged. Corpus migration: ZERO
  genuine unused imports (a 632-file scan flagged only two pre-existing ERROR fixtures where a
  prior error — import-name redeclaration, invalid package id — supersedes). Two stale ParseTests
  that pinned the old leniency (`parse_import_clause_is_ignored`) retargeted to the enforced
  bottom. Tests in `ImportEnforcementTests.lean` (16 new theorems). Both halves of cue's import
  contract (declared ⇔ used) now hold.

### 2026-07-05 two-phase audit findings (batch `d6dac7c..HEAD`: `mod get` leg2 + unused-import)

A4 (audit-the-last-audit): the 2026-07-05 Phase-B filings reconcile clean — AUD-B2/B3/B4 all landed
(DONE, unchanged); **AUD-B5 re-verified STILL OPEN + correctly scoped** — `buildDiskGraphAux`
(`Module.lean:385`) and `fetchGraphAux` (`ModCmd.lean:91`) are byte-for-byte the two BFS builders
AUD-B5 describes; leg2 added no third graph walk (`mod get` uses tags/list, not a graph), so the
LOW/deferred verdict stands. Not closable, not newly urgent.
  - **[RETRACTED — AUD-B5 landed]** Both walks now share `Module.bfsRequirementGraphAux`; see the
    AUD-B5 DONE entry under "Open Phase-B fix-slices".

**Phase A — one REAL bug fixed inline, one MEDIUM latent false-positive filed:**

- **MODGET-COMMENT-EXCISION (correctness — silent module.cue corruption). ✅ FIXED (this audit).**
  Adversarial probe of `exciseTopLevelDeps`/`dropBalanced` (`ModCmd.lean`) found the textual deps
  splicer was NOT comment-aware: a `//` or `/* */` comment carrying an unbalanced `}` (or a lone
  `"`) INSIDE the deps block made `dropBalanced` mis-close early, splicing the deps-block remnants
  back into module.cue as top-level content — `applyModGet` then emitted a corrupt file (no error,
  `found=true`). A top-level comment with an unbalanced `{` raised brace depth and hid the following
  deps field (errored on a valid file). FIX: replaced the `(inString, escaped)` bool pair in both
  scanners with a `Lex` sum type (`normal | str escaped | line | block`) — illegal-states
  (escaped-while-not-in-string) now unrepresentable — and taught both to skip `//`/`/* */` (braces
  and quotes inside a comment are inert; comments are copied verbatim by the excision). Six
  `native_decide` regressions added to `ModCmdTests` (line-comment `}` in deps, block-comment `}{"`
  in deps, lone `"` in a line comment, top-level `{` comment, end-to-end `applyModGet` no-corrupt).
  All previously-adversarial shapes now correct; build + `check.sh` green.
  **[Superseded in part — BLOCK-COMMENT-REJECT (2026-07-11)]:** block comments are no longer part of
  CUE, so the `.block` Lex state and its scanner arms were removed; module.cue block comments are now
  rejected upstream at `parseSource`. The block-comment excision test was replaced by an
  `applyModGet`-rejects-block-comment pin. The `.line`/string comment-awareness is unchanged.
- **UNUSED-IMPORT-BINDNAME / AUD-B6 (MEDIUM — latent false-positive). DONE 2026-07-06** — resolved
  as the F-3 suffix-vs-declared-name MISMATCH gate, NOT the audit's assumed "defer + accept". The
  audit expected `import ".../foo"` (dir declares `package bar`) used as `bar.Field` to be a false
  unused-flag on a VALID program; `cue` v0.16.1 REJECTS that program (`no files in package directory
  with package name "foo"`, demanding the `:bar` qualifier). So the divergence set is exactly the
  programs `cue` rejects — the naive "give the check the declaredName arm" fix would make Kue ACCEPT
  a `cue`-illegal import (wrong-direction divergence). Root-cause fix: `collectBindings` now enforces
  the loaded package's `package` clause == the import's expected name (qualifier, else last path
  element); a mismatch is a cue-shaped load error. That keeps `importBindName` purely LEXICAL (one
  param-free resolution in `Value.lean`, shared by the parse-time unused check and the loader binder —
  `Parse.importLocalBindName` deleted, DRY), so a bound package's name always equals its
  last-path-element/qualifier and the parse-time check can never mis-name a used import. Fixtures:
  `import_bare_pkgname_mismatch` (expected.err, cue-shaped) + `import_qualifier_pkgname_rescue`
  (`:bar` rescues, byte-identical to cue). See implementation-log 2026-07-06.

Emitter (`parseDeps`/`renderDepsBlock`) canonical form re-checked against the committed
byte-identical-to-`cue`-v0.16.1 fixtures (tab indent, `{v: "…"}` shape, ascending key sort) — SOUND;
not re-run against the live registry (offline gate). Guards: `collectReferencedHeads` fully
enumerated (no `Value` catch-all); `hasTopLevelField`'s `_` is a Bool probe (allowed); totality
holds (all new scanners fuel-bounded, no `partial def`); `check-comments` green.

**Phase B — placement CLEAN, no refactor warranted.** `mod get` machinery is coherently homed in
`ModCmd` (sibling to `mod tidy`); `Oci.tagsListUrl` sits with `manifestUrl` in the OCI URL family;
`collectReferencedHeads`/`unusedImports` sit in `Parse` immediately after the mirror
`applyBuiltinAliases`/`importedBuiltinPackages` import machinery. `parseDeps` is the single deps
reader, shared by tidy (`depsFromEntries`) and get (`applyModGet`) — no new duplication. The only
open architecture item is the pre-existing AUD-B5 (re-affirmed above). No dead code; graph stays
acyclic/layered. No inline Phase-B change.
  <!-- RETRACTED: AUD-B5 has since landed (Module.bfsRequirementGraphAux); no open architecture
       item remains from this batch. -->


### 2026-07-04 Phase A audit findings (batch `dfdd1ab..HEAD`: list-slice / interp-typing / byte-escapes)

Batch verdict: all three code changes SOUND. A4 reconciliation clean (STRUCT-EQ-LEAF-TYPESENSE
divergence row + `numeric/equality_expressions` fixtures present and match code; PRIM-FLOAT-PARSED
still open; ARCH-QUOTED-STRIP / GDA-FLOAT-RENDER / BYTES-SLICE-MISSING / BYTE-INTERPOLATION /
BUILTIN-IMPORT-LENIENCY all still tracked, no decay). [Retraction 2026-07-05: PRIM-FLOAT-PARSED
and GDA-FLOAT-RENDER have since LANDED — see their entries above.] Two LOW findings:

- **INTERP-STRUCT-PATTERN-DEFER (LOW — correctness/consistency). ✅ DONE 2026-07-04.** Collapsed
  both struct arms of `classifyInterpolationPart` (`Kue/EvalBase.lean`) to a single pattern-agnostic
  `.struct _ _ _ _ _ => .nonInterpolatable .struct` — a pattern-bearing struct now ERRORS (bottom)
  like a plain struct instead of over-DEFERring, matching cue's eval type-error on
  `"\({[string]:int})"`. Exhaustiveness preserved (struct covered once). Regression: `out_pattern`
  in `numeric/interpolation_type_error` fixture (`→ _|_`) + native_decide guard in `Tests.lean`
  (pattern-struct → bottom; incomplete-scalar interp still DEFERS). real-world gate empty.
- **BYTE-HIGHBYTE-NO-RED-SEED (test-debt / rule-compliance). ✅ SEEDED 2026-07-04 → GRADUATED GREEN
  2026-07-05** (BYTE-ARRAY-REPR rank 0f). Wild seed `testdata/wild/byte-literal-high-byte`
  (`a: '\xff'` → `{ "a": "/w==" }`) was RED against HEAD (kue exported `w78=`, the 2-byte UTF-8 of
  U+00FF); the `Array UInt8` carrier now holds the raw byte 0xFF as one octet, so the seed passes and
  its `.known-red` quarantine was removed. Octal `'\377'` is the same byte, also green.

The **2026-07-04 Phase B audit** (`dfdd1ab..HEAD`; A7 GATES/TOOLING infra-rotation cycle) closed
HEALTHY. Phase A fixes confirmed landed (INTERP-STRUCT-PATTERN-DEFER at `EvalBase.lean:1162`;
BYTE-HIGHBYTE seed tracked). PART 1: the three String-backed-bytes items consolidate under one
core-type fix-slice **BYTE-ARRAY-REPR (rank 0f, MEDIUM)** — `Array UInt8` carrier,
folds BYTE-HIGHBYTE, keeps BYTES-SLICE / BYTE-INTERPOLATION as dependents. A7 infra: `check.sh` +
`handle_known_red` DRY (holding across both gates) + strict-xfail + realworld + test-health all
SOUND; seed hygiene PASS (24 wild, 2 `.known-red`, both tracked+filed); FixturePorts (generated,
exempt) not unmanageable. Architecture CLEAN: graph acyclic/layered, list-slice desugar no layer
blur. No inline code change (all findings non-trivial). Periodic passes: plan-hygiene/test-org NOT
due, perf-guide current, resilience/retro APPROACHING. **The 2026-07-04 two-phase audit is COMPLETE.**

### Audit status — all filed fix-slices DISCHARGED

The **2026-07-02 two-phase audit** fix-slice batch is FULLY DISCHARGED — (a) TEST-HEALTH
retrofit + `scripts/check-test-health.sh`, (b) value-producing `| _ =>` enumeration (13
in-scope `Eval.lean` sites; a new `Value` ctor now fails exhaustiveness), (c) `Module.lean`
`partial def` waivers + list self-recursions rewritten structural, (d) `for`-over-non-iterable
type-error (`classifyForSource`, E#4), (e) timeless-comment sweep (non-test source), PA-1
(bottom-`for`-source propagation via `ForSourceClass.bottom`), B-AUDIT-refold-1
(`refoldEmbeddingsIfSelf` shared helper), PB-1 (`EvalBase → EvalDefer → Eval` carve — the tier
depends on base helpers the core-force also uses, so a 3-module split, not 1), PB-2
(`ClosednessTests`/`ResidualTests` split), PB-3 (`architecture.md` §5 edge note). Detail: log.

The **2026-07-03 two-phase audit** closed CLEAN, both phases, zero fix-slices filed. Phase A
(`08a537e..HEAD` eval batch, `a8d07b7`): A4 verified all five prior fix-slices landed in code
(none decayed); the L5-2 open-tail-operand closedness verdict re-derived SOUND (no
under-rejection across meet orders, 3-way conjunctions, nested, field-referenced). Phase B
(`7487d06`, A7 infra-in-scope rotation): module graph layering/cycles clean, the
`EvalOps → EvalBase → EvalDefer → Eval` carve matched by `architecture.md`; infra (`check.sh` /
`./lake`+`./lean` cap / strict-xfail quarantine / `check-realworld.sh` + sanitized real-world fixture)
all sound; one LOW hole fixed inline (`check.sh` now shellchecks the `./lake`/`./lean` root
wrappers). Toolchain is Lean **v4.31.0** (`1d7fc37`). No open audit-filed fix-slice remains.

The **2026-07-04 Phase B audit** (`a8d07b7..HEAD` + whole-graph; A7 infra-rotation cycle) closed
with the module graph HEALTHY and TWO new fix-slices filed. A4: both Phase A fixes verified landed
IN CODE (`stripFieldQuoting` wired at both seams post-`checkLetFieldShadow`; `mapRefsValueWithFuel`
catch-all enumerated) — neither decayed. Architecture verdicts: the `mapRefsValueWithFuel` unified
walker is GOOD reuse (AD4-1 leaf-differs shape, not the DRY-1 trap); file-scoped imports' NUL-sep
synthetic label + shadow-aware rewrite is CLEAN, Module/Resolve boundary intact; `Field.quoted` +
strip-walk is SOUND but carries an unenforced "must-strip" invariant → filed **ARCH-QUOTED-STRIP**
(rank 0c — DONE 2026-07-05 via the `Quoted`-newtype Option B, not the filed parse-only-quoting
mechanism; see 0c). A7 infra: `check.sh` aggregator + `./lake`/`./lean` caps sound; the
two-gate `.known-red` quarantine is DUPLICATED → filed **GATE-KNOWNRED-DRY** (LOW tail). AUDIT-
STRUCT-EQ re-scoped (split; see rank 0b). No inline code change (all findings non-trivial). Periodic
passes: test-org/plan-hygiene/perf-guide NOT due; resilience/retro APPROACHING (flagged, not
overdue). The **2026-07-04 two-phase audit is now COMPLETE.**

The **2026-07-05 two-phase audit** (bytes/mvs/mod-tidy batch `88f02a8..`) is COMPLETE. Phase A
(`f9e5ae6`) filed AUD-A1..A4 to the log; Phase B RESOLVED all four in code (unlike prior phases,
this one refactored): AUD-A3 DRY (`mainPathConflict : Option String`, `solveChecked` reuses it,
`0202aa5`); AUD-A4 illegal-states (`cueSumRows` folds over fetched nodes so every row carries its
`h1` — can't-happen drop erased, `ecbe8ac`); AUD-A1 unused simp args (`ace8898`); AUD-A2
convention-migration (timeless-comment sweep of ~27 sites + `scripts/check-comments.sh` grep gate
over `Kue/**/*.lean`, `17f9f02`). One NEW finding resolved inline — AUD-B1: `Mvs.solveMany` was
dead/untested speculative surface, now pinned by `mvs_multi_root_pins_each_and_sorts_shared`.
Architecture verdicts clean: `ModCmd` carve from `Module` has no back-coupling/cycle; `ModCmd`/`Mvs`
`partial`-free (fuel-bounded); mod-tidy fixtures consistent + gate self-validating (dynamic `h1:`);
byte-carrier change clean (base64 centralized, no String residue). A whole-graph Explore scan filed
three fix-slices (below). Detail: log.

The **2026-07-05 (batch-5) two-phase audit** (`7b6e66f..e10d282`: ARCH-QUOTED-STRIP plan 0c,
PRIM-FLOAT-PARSED plan 0e) is COMPLETE — **BOTH PHASES CLEAN, zero new fix-slices**. Phase A
hard-verified the two designated high-value points: the inert `BEq Quoted := ⟨fun _ _ => true⟩`
is SAFE (Value/Field derive only `Repr, BEq` — no `DecidableEq`/`LawfulBEq` to contradict it; the
sole quoting readers `letBinderLabel`/`collidableFieldLabel` read `field.quoted.value` directly,
never via `BEq`; `valueDigest` already omitted quoted so BEq/digest now consistent by construction;
`Coe Bool Quoted` one-directional, no surprising elaboration), and `mkFloatText`'s
`.getD (intDecimal 0)` fallback is UNREACHABLE (all 10 sites feed lexer- or own-formatter text; no
unvalidated string reaches it → no masked-`0` bug, no wild fixture). No new `Value` catch-all;
`check-comments` green; convention migrated with its surface. Phase B verified `DecimalValue`
above `Prim` is coherent (no forward-ref), `mkFloatText` is the SOLE float route (only raw `.float`
is inside it + an identity passthrough), and no dead code from the `stripFieldQuoting` deletion
(`builtinAliasFuel` still consumed by `canonicalizeBuiltinCalls`). AUD-B2/B4 re-verified STILL OPEN
+ correctly scoped. Detail: log.

The **2026-07-05 (batch-4) two-phase audit** (`6012a8e..41dbe9e`: AUD-B3 enumeration,
STRUCT-EQ half-2, NESTED-DISJ-MARK reframe) is COMPLETE — **BOTH PHASES CLEAN, zero new
fix-slices** (a valid clean-audit outcome, no work invented). Phase A verified
`classifyScalarOperand` + `normalizeFieldOrder` each enumerate all 29 `Value` constructors
with no `Value` catch-all (class-enum catch-alls permitted), the new tests carry
over-collapse + negative guards (not happy-path), and the timeless-comment gate is green.
Phase B verified `normalizeFieldOrder` placement (colocated with its sole consumer
`dedupAlternatives`), no duplication with `canonicalizeFields`/`conjMemberLe`, and the
coarse `eqUpToFieldOrder` confinement leak-proof (used only in the dedup path; global `BEq`
untouched for cycle detection). AUD-B2/B4 re-verified STILL OPEN + correctly scoped. Detail: log.

The **2026-07-05 (leg4/float/import batch) two-phase audit** (`6eafcf5..HEAD`:
GDA-FLOAT-RENDER `7996477`, BUILTIN-IMPORT-LENIENCY `1f292a8`, B3d-6b-leg4 `33ca159`,
consolidation `3f0f378`) is COMPLETE — **Phase A CLEAN (zero fix-slices), Phase B ONE LOW
finding filed (AUD-B5, deferred with tradeoff)**. A4 (audit-the-last-audit): the batch-4
Phase-B filings AUD-B2 (modtidy zip source) and AUD-B4 (`textBytes` in-place note) landed in
this batch's consolidation commit `3f0f378` — VERIFIED (`scripts/gen-modtidy-fixtures.py`
regenerates the five zips from readable `src/` trees; the `textBytes` rationale note is at the
def in `Kue/Value.lean`). Both correctly DISCHARGED.

Phase A hard-verified the four designated high-value points against real call sites:
- **Float apd rendering** — `floatApdForm` parses EVERY float `text` the lexer can emit
  (lexer normalizes the exponent to lowercase `e` with an explicit sign and strips a leading
  `+`, so the lowercase-`e`-only split is sound) AND every eval-produced float text
  (`formatFiniteDecimal`/`divideDecimalRational?`/`negateFloatText` emit only plain
  `[-]W[.F]`, never scientific). The `1e-6`/`1e-7` plain↔scientific boundary is correct
  (`exponent ≤ 0 ∧ adjusted ≥ −6`). Cross-checked `cue` on `100.0`/`10.0e1`/`250e-2`/`0.0`/
  `1e2`/`1e-7` across JSON/YAML/cue — all three surfaces byte-match.
- **Import enforcement** — no un-imported builtin path slips the gate: `applyBuiltinAliases`
  runs at BOTH parse entrypoints (`parseDocument`, `parseDocumentFile`), per-file; no
  `.builtinCall` for a qualified name is constructed after the gate except the eval-time
  `json/yaml.Marshal` re-defer (which only fires for a call that already passed the gate);
  the only no-call stdlib constants are `list.Ascending/Descending/Comparer`, all routed
  through the import-checked `resolveBuiltinConstSelector`. No legitimately-imported builtin
  is wrongly rejected (aliased + unaliased call and constant forms all resolve; gate keys off
  the canonicalized package name against `importedBuiltinPackages`).
- **leg-4 override** — a currently-resolving lenient load is never regressed: a
  declared-but-unvendored dep makes `buildDiskGraphAux` error → `solveVersionOverride` returns
  an EMPTY override (per-hop fallback); `solveChecked` errors ONLY on a dep requiring the main
  module's OWN path (the genuine cue-reject case), never on a benign graph. `ModuleContext.selected`
  is threaded through all three construction sites (`loadPackageDir`, `loadFileBound`, the
  recursive `depCtx`) — no hop drops it into the `[]` default.
- **Guards** — no swallowing `| _ =>` on a Value-producing match (the `.selector`-arm
  `| _ => .selector (rec' base) label` is a `.ref?` probe inside a fully-enumerated outer
  match, not a dispatch swallow); `gateBuiltinImport`'s `_` is on a `List String` splitOn
  result; `check-comments` green; the import convention migrated with its enforcement.

**Open Phase-B fix-slices (2026-07-05, ranked):**
- **AUD-B5 (LOW) — DONE.** Extracted `Module.bfsRequirementGraphAux` — a generic
  `(nodeOf : α → ModuleVersion) (expand : α → IO (Except String (List α × β))) (fuelExhausted)`
  combinator, structural on `fuel` (⇒ total, no `partial`; `expand` is a leaf callback that never
  recurses, keeping structural-recursion inference intact — the AD4-1 shape). `buildDiskGraphAux`
  (`Kue/Module.lean`, disk-first) and `fetchGraphAux` (`Kue/ModCmd.lean`, registry) are now thin
  call sites; both fuel-exhaustion messages preserved byte-for-byte. Pure refactor — the mod-tidy +
  disk-graph fixtures are the guard; `./scripts/check.sh` green.
- **AUD-B3 (MEDIUM) — DONE (`6012a8e`).** Routed all six Value-producing catch-all sites
  (`evalBoolBinary`/`evalBoolNot`/`evalNumPos`/`evalNumNeg`, plus the same-pattern
  `evalPrimitiveOrdering`/`evalRegexMatch` — converted together per the "convention lands with its
  migration" Law) through one enumerated `classifyScalarOperand : Value -> ScalarOperandClass`
  (no `Value` catch-all; the residual dispatch is now on the finite class enum, like
  `classifyArithOperand`). Strictly behavior-preserving; 14 `native_decide` residual-preservation
  pins added. No grep guard: the compliant fix idiom emits a line `| _, _ => .binary …` matching the
  CLASS enum — syntactically identical to a banned `Value` catch-all (and to `arithmeticDomainResult`),
  so no cheap grep separates compliant from banned. Stays reviewer-enforced.
- **AUD-B2 (LOW) — DONE (2026-07-05).** The five `testdata/ocifetch/modtidy/*.zip` are no longer
  opaque: the file tree each encodes is checked in under `testdata/ocifetch/modtidy/src/<name>/`
  (readable `cue.mod/module.cue` + package `.cue`), regenerated by `scripts/gen-modtidy-fixtures.py`
  (zips each `src/<name>/` → `<name>.zip`), with a `README.md` on regen. Reproducible, not opaque;
  gate stays green (h1 dirhashes are content-derived at run time, so container churn is free).
  Regenerated zips verified content-identical to the originals.
- **AUD-B4 (LOW) — DONE / DOCUMENTED IN PLACE (2026-07-05).** `Value.textBytes` (`Kue/Value.lean`)
  is test-only but stays in core: relocating it would cost seven new imports across the seven test
  modules that use it (they share no common test-support import) for a one-line `Value`-domain
  constructor helper — a move that ripples awkwardly for zero core benefit. Left in place with a
  test-support-in-core rationale note at the def (the lower-churn correct option per the AUD-B4 brief).

The **2026-07-04 Phase A audit** (`a8d07b7..HEAD`: file-scoped imports `53fe3cc`, let/alias
no-shadow forward `e20af9a` + reverse `f128600`) found ONE HIGH regression and ONE LOW latent —
filed as AUDIT-QUOTED-BEQ (rank 0) and AUDIT-RESOLVE-CATCHALL (LOW tail) above; Phase B owed. A4:
the 2026-07-03 audit was CLEAN (zero fix-slices), nothing to verify-landed — confirmed. Verified
CLEAN: the mechanical ~2,500-site `, false` `Tests/` pass is behavior-preserving (Lean's
type-directed `⟨⟩` elaboration precludes a silent mis-target; `, false` makes the pre-existing
`quoted` default explicit); `Field.quoted` is set-once at the genuine quoted parse site
(`parseQuotedLabelField`, `Parse.lean:1664`) and read only by `collidableFieldLabel` (the leak into
`BEq` is the AUDIT-QUOTED-BEQ finding, not a second bug); the unified `checkLetFieldShadow` /
predicate-parameterised `collectMemberLabels` is correct both directions, DRY, and readable (its
`| _ => []` is a `List String` COLLECTOR terminal, not a Value-dispatch), with real over-rejection
accept-guards (quoted/def/dynamic/for-var/comprehension-let/incomparable-sibling) and an EMPTY
real-world gate; file-scoped imports' `mapRefsValueWithFuel` unification shares every binder
frame and its NUL-separated synthetic labels are uncollidable + `importBinding`-class (non-output)
+ shadow-aware; the `cue-spec-gaps` reverse no-shadow row is CLOSED and matches the code.

### Plan-only roadmap — resolved items (ruling + pointer; detail in the log + git)

1. **`truncate-primitive` (soundness hardening) — CLOSED.** One `EvalState.truncate` choke
   point (Step 1 done); the `withFuel` combinator RULED OUT (a lambda hides `fuel=n+1`, breaks
   `termination_by`).
2. **EvalOps extraction → `Kue/EvalOps.lean` — DONE (2026-06-22).** Pure scalar algebra carved
   out; import shape `EvalOps → {Builtin, Decimal, Regex}`, no back-edge.
3. **Test/fixture-org — splits DONE; fixture regroup DEFERRED (LOW tail above).**
   **TEST-HEALTH CONVENTION (durable, applies to ALL new/touched `Kue/Tests/*.lean`):** section
   headers are `--` LINE comments, never `/-- -/`/`/-! -/` block comments (a line comment cannot
   swallow the next theorem); every test module carries an end-of-file
   `#check @<last-theorem-per-section>` tripwire. `FixturePorts.lean` is generated data (exempt).
   Machine-enforced by `scripts/check-test-health.sh` (repo-wide retrofit landed; ≤1800-line cap).
4. **Field-ordering parity #3 — RATIFIED CLOSED: Kue keeps source order; parity DECLINED.**
   Spec silent (structs unordered, output order implementation-defined) → Kue's declaration order
   is the principled, test-pinned choice; `cue`'s cross-conjunct order is an undocumented
   internal-graph artifact. `cue-spec-gaps.md` RATIFIED row. Reopen only if a fixture demands
   cue's exact bytes (none does).
5. **Per-eval-cost perf frontier — CLOSED (2026-06-23).** Hash digest DONE (119s → ~30s on a
   large real config); perf #7 safe wins landed; frame-sharing WON'T-FIX (above); per-eval constant
   floor-characterized; multi-ref-cyclic flatten fan-out FIXED (visited-path bound). Only
   remaining lever is user-controllable flatten/shorten. Full data: `kue-performance.md` + log.
6. **Borderline / LOW open items — see § Ranked OPEN backlog + LOW tail above.**
   `module-file-scoped-imports` DONE 2026-07-03 (`53fe3cc`): imports FILE-SCOPED via a synthetic
   NUL-separated label (`fileScopedImportLabel`, uncollidable) + a shadow-aware pre-merge ref
   rewrite (`rewriteFileImportRefs`) riding the same `mapRefsValueWithFuel` traversal as
   reference resolution; package FIELDS still merge and stay shared. All three faces green
   (collision + shadow seeds graduated; sibling-invisible pinned as an `.err` fixture; binder-form
   shadow guard byte-identical to cue). Other DONE item-6 members (B2-A2, B-AUDIT-refold-1,
   scalar-embed-with-decls, TL-1/TL-2, import-eager-closedness, parser-strictness, release-tooling,
   DRY `selectEvaluatedField .disj`, value-rewrite catch-all enumeration, B3, A2-y,
   aliased-builtin/constant resolution, `resolveEmbeddedDisjDefault` narrowing): see log.
7. **CLI / entry-UX.** Bare `kue` prints help; stdin eval explicit (`kue eval`) — Entry-UX fix
   DONE (2026-06-24). **NEW SCOPED OBJECTIVE (awaiting user direction — do NOT self-start):** the
   broader cue-aligned CLI surface (`vet`/`fmt`/`def`, a `-` explicit-stdin marker, flag parity).
   Known DEFERRED: `kue --version` reports `0.1.0-alpha`, not the dated tag — defensible as-is.
   **Module-fetch architecture — DECIDED (2026-06-25): full Lean 4, NOT a Go frankenstein.** The
   cgo Go-shell + Lean-engine spike was REJECTED by chakrit (leaky seam vs correctness +
   human-traceability); do not re-spike. See `docs/decisions/2026-06-25-lean-engine-embedded-in-go-via-cgo.md`.

## B3d track — CLOSED (audit history distilled 2026-06-26)

The registry/OCI module-fetch track (decision:
`docs/decisions/2026-06-25-registry-fetch-via-curl-subprocess.md`) landed end-to-end.
Modules: `Registry` (CUE_REGISTRY parse + module→OCI-ref + cache-path authority), `Oci`
(manifest parse + URL/curl-arg builders), `OciAuth` (bearer-token flow parsing), `OciFetch`
(the sole `IO.Process` curl edge + the three integrity gates), `Sha256` (FIPS 180-4 + `h1:`
dirhash), `Inflate` (RFC 1951 DEFLATE), `Zip` (PKWARE + CRC-32), `Semver` (Go `x/mod/semver`
port), `Mvs` (pure MVS solver), and `Module.lean` wiring (`fetchAndCacheModule` + atomic
cache-write). B3d-1...B3d-5 (+5a/5z), B3d-6a, B3d-A1, and B3d-7 (OCI bearer-token auth — proven
LIVE against real `ghcr.io` for a private-registry module) are DONE. Per-slice detail:
`implementation-log.md` (71+ B3d entries) + git.

Both 2026-06-26 audit rounds closed **HEALTHY**: module graph is a clean DAG (IO confined to
`OciFetch`+`Module`; `Eval`/`Resolve`/`Value` import ZERO B3d module); the three integrity gates
(blob `sha256:` digest, zip CRC-32+size, `cue.sum` `h1:`) are enforced and unbypassable on the
production path; inflate is total (fuel-bounded, malformed → typed-error). Totality
`#print axioms`-pinned (stdlib axioms only). 🔒 Secret hygiene (B3d-7): a credential/token lives
only in curl argv + in-memory strings, never logged/persisted; errors report outcomes, never the
secret. `Mvs.solve` is WIRED both into `kue mod tidy` (via `Mvs.solveChecked`, the main-pin fix, over a
registry-fetched graph) AND into the IMPORT-RESOLUTION path (B3d-6b-leg4, 2026-07-05: a disk-built
requirement graph governs import version selection — max-of-mins, not per-hop) — no longer a
staged-but-unused primitive.

**Open B3d items (ranked):**
- **B3d-6b — FULLY LANDED 2026-07-05 (all legs).** Legs (1) requirement-graph fetch, (3) `mod tidy`
  command parse + dispatch, (5) `cue.sum` WRITE, and the `Mvs.solve` main-pin fix landed via
  `Kue/ModCmd.lean` + `kue mod tidy` (offline gate `scripts/check-mod-tidy.lean`); leg 4
  (export-path MVS) and leg 2 (`mod get`) landed same-day. **No FILED dependents remain.**
  - **B3d-6b-leg4 — export-path MVS rewiring — LANDED 2026-07-05.** The MVS build list now governs
    the IMPORT-RESOLUTION path (`Module.lean`'s mutual loader): at load entry `solveVersionOverride`
    builds the requirement graph OFF DISK (`buildDiskRequirementGraph` — root-threaded BFS over each
    dep's on-disk `cue.mod/module.cue` via `locateModuleDir`+`readModuleInfo`, total, no network),
    runs `Mvs.solveChecked`, and threads the build-list projection (bare path → version) through the
    new `ModuleContext.selected` field; `resolveImportTarget` overrides each cross-module import's
    version with the selected one. Cross-module selection is now max-of-mins, not per-hop. On-disk
    diamond fixture `testdata/modules/crossmod_diamond` (`a`→c@v0.1.0, `b`→c@v0.2.0; MVS picks
    v0.2.0 for both) — red-first proved per-hop gave `fromA`=v0.1.0, the fix gives v0.2.0 both,
    cross-checked byte-identical against cue v0.16.1. **Regression-safe by construction:** a
    single-version graph selects each path's only version (override is a no-op), and a non-buildable
    graph falls back to an EMPTY override (per-hop, today's behavior) — the real-world gate
    re-ran byte-identical. 7 new `native_decide` tests pin diamond/3-deep/single/main-conflict
    selection + `selectedVersion`. Divergence CLOSED in `compat-assumptions.md`. The flat-requirement
    *enforcement* (cue requires every transitive dep pinned in main) is deliberately NOT in scope —
    kue discovers deps transitively; that stays a separate, bounded leniency.
  - **B3d-6b-leg2 — `mod get` + tags/list — LANDED 2026-07-05.** `kue mod get <module>[@version]`
    adds/updates a dependency in `cue.mod/module.cue`. Three pure capabilities + one IO edge, all
    in `Kue/ModCmd.lean`: (a) the **deps-block emitter** — parse the existing module.cue for its
    deps, merge the target (keyed on module path + major, so distinct majors coexist), re-render
    ONLY the `deps` block in cue's canonical tab-indented form via a string/brace-aware textual
    excision that preserves all non-deps content (illegal-states-unrepresentable: a present-but-
    unlocatable deps block ERRORS rather than emit a conflicting file); (b) **tag "latest"
    resolution** — bare/`@latest`/`@vN`/`@vN.M` filter the registry `.../tags/list` to valid
    non-prerelease semver matching the constraint and take the max (`Semver.maxVersion`); (c) the
    pure driver `modGetResolveAndApply` (source + arg + in-memory tags → new source), so the whole
    pipeline is `native_decide`-checkable OFFLINE. Byte-identical to `cue mod get` v0.16.1 for the
    canonical (block-form) add. Divergence: kue preserves non-deps content verbatim where cue
    reformats the whole file — spec-silent, recorded in `cue-spec-gaps.md`. 40 `native_decide`
    tests (`Tests/ModCmdTests.lean`) + CLI parse pins (`Tests/CliTests.lean`). The read-only
    tags/list GET (`ociListTags`) is production-only; no gate depends on the network.
- **B3d-A2** (test-strength, LOW) — DONE 2026-07-05. Pinned every adversarial DEFLATE/ZIP reject
  branch to its EXACT typed error (not just "is error"), so a wrong branch firing fails the pin.
  14 new `native_decide` theorems in `Tests/ZipTests.lean`: 9 DEFLATE (STORED LEN/NLEN, dist-too-
  far-back, invalid dist code, litlen-symbol-286-OOR, dynamic bad-CLC, dynamic invalid-litlen,
  dynamic dist-symbol-30-OOR, block fuel-exhaustion, + the prior BTYPE=3) and 5 ZIP (short/no-EOCD,
  bad CD sig, unsupported method, bad local sig, CRC mismatch, size mismatch). Malformed DEFLATE
  streams bit-crafted + cross-checked against Python `zlib` (raw, wbits=-15); ZIPs are single-field
  mutations of `storedZip`. NO soundness bug: every branch already rejected correctly (the fuel
  guard fires on a truncated 1-bit-literal stream — proven no-hang). Distance-symbol-30 and
  literal-symbol-286 are reachable only via a dynamic table / the fixed table's over-wide code
  space; the block-loop fuel guard and the dynamic-length-underflow guard are defensive-unreachable
  by construction (each block/RLE-step consumes ≥1 unit against a matched bound) and left un-pinned.
- **B3d-B1 — DONE 2026-07-10 (type-leverage).** The `cue.sum` `h1:` string is now the `Kue.Hash1`
  newtype threaded produce→accumulate→format/parse→verify, so a raw string can no longer reach a
  digest position; the main-module node (which never had a digest) was dropped from the fetched-node
  table entirely rather than carrying a sentinel — `runTidy` supplies its graph edge directly. The
  OCI `Descriptor.digest` (`sha256:<hex>`) was left a bare `String`: a distinct concern with no
  second consumer, so a newtype there would be ceremony.
- **`Mvs.solve` main-pin — DONE 2026-07-05.** `Mvs.solveChecked` surfaces the cue-panic case
  (a dependency requiring a higher version of the main module's own path) as a typed error
  instead of a silent pin; `mod tidy` calls it. 4 native_decide theorems.
- **`Kue/ModuleFetch.lean` carve — DONE 2026-07-05 (as `Kue/ModCmd.lean`).** B3d-6b's command
  layer (transitive graph fetch + cue.sum write + `mod tidy` orchestration) was carved into a new
  `Kue/ModCmd.lean` rather than growing `Module.lean` past the ~200-line trigger; `Module.lean`
  keeps import resolution + the shared fetch/cache primitives.
- **`kue-performance.md` B3d note** (doc, LOW) — inflate is O(output) fuel-bounded; fetch latency
  is curl/network-dominated, off the eval hot path. Fold into a coming B3d slice.

## Resolved / ruled-out (recorded so they are not re-raised)

### Audit-round history (all HEALTHY; per-round detail in implementation-log.md + git)

Every two-phase audit round 2026-06-21..07-03 closed HEALTHY/CLEAN; each round's full write-up
is an implementation-log entry + its own commit. Rounds: `1bd93d8..fc5456d` +
`9afd54c`-baseline Phase-B (2026-06-25, B3d foundation); `890d453..2bd75eb` (A2-y);
`e2d8868..4431597` (parser-strictness + release-tooling); `db8700f..HEAD` (nested-disj-mark
deferral + disj-select DRY); `735dc10..0459beb` (flatten-bound + SC-4); `32643f5..2bbdb05`
(Bug2-12 MUTUAL); `fccab69..6f77bfe` (Bug2-12 + missing-field-selection); `50a0db3..14fb23e`
(perf #7 safe wins); `20b8397..32ddfda` (catch-all refactor + embed-disj-arm-closedness);
`f40dd9c..4b24902` (B3d-7 + eval-L1/L2); the 2026-07-02 two-phase audit (fix-slices a–e + PA/PB,
all discharged); the 2026-07-03 two-phase audit (`a8d07b7`/`7487d06`, both CLEAN). The
resilience/retrospective pass (once flagged OVERDUE) rode the `890d453..2bd75eb` batch; its
learnings live in `failure-modes.md` + `slice-loop.md`.

**Consolidated milestone (2026-06-23).** A large real config exported content-identical and the
per-eval perf frontier CLOSED; the follow-on root-A soundness over-accept and the L1–L5 fixes are
COMPLETE (see § List-embed, default-disjunction & def-closedness fixes). Released
`v0.1.0-alpha.20260623` (3 platforms, race-safe tooling).

### Durable whole-graph facts (a future audit re-verifies these)

The module graph is ACYCLIC + strictly layered (`Builtin → {Lattice, Regex, Decimal,
Base64, Json, Yaml, CaseTable}`, NO `Eval`/`EvalOps` edge; `EvalOps → {Builtin, Decimal,
Regex}` no back-edge; the evaluator is the carved chain `EvalBase → EvalDefer → Eval`, with
`Eval → {Builtin, Decimal, EvalOps, Lattice, Regex, Normalize}`;
`Lattice → {Value, Regex, StringFormat}`; `Order → {Value, Regex, StringFormat}`;
`Runtime → Eval`; `Module → {Parse, Runtime, Registry, OciFetch, Zip, Sha256}`;
`OciFetch → {Oci, OciAuth, Base64, Sha256, Registry}`; `Cli → Runtime`; `Normalize → Value`).
The stdlib string-format validators are independent sibling leaves — `Strconv`, `Path`, `Time`,
`Net`, `TextTemplate` each `→ Value` only, no cross-edges among them (the former `Time → Net`
edge is DELETED); `StringFormat → {Time, Net}` is the single join that hosts `stringFormatValid`,
imported by `Lattice`/`Order`.
The marshalling builtins are a deliberate forward edge into export (`Builtin → Json → Manifest`,
`Yaml → Json`) — legitimate layering, not a cycle. Cleanliness sweeps clean (no
`sorry`/`panic!`/`unreachable!`/`.get!`-in-pure-code, no dead code, no stale markers;
`partial def`s are the `Parse.lean`/`Module.lean` carve-outs only, each waived; `Eval`+`Lattice`
FULLY total). Test-health guarded by the TEST-HEALTH CONVENTION + `check-test-health.sh`.

### Durable rulings (one paragraph each; do not re-litigate)

- **Walker / normalizer dedup family — FULLY CLOSED.** The walkers were NEVER one problem
  — three distinct walker families + a separate normalizer pair, different
  mechanisms/result-types/recursion-domains/termination measures; folding them under one
  abstraction is a false "stuff they all do" extraction. AD4-1 + A-EN3 DONE; DRY-1 RULED
  OUT; AD2-1 RESOLVED (unified); `embedChainAny` SHARED (`0619097`). No open members.
- **CARRIER-DECL-SELECT (DRY, LOW) — DONE 2026-06-22.** `selectFromDecls` extracted;
  all six byte-identical Eval sites routed through it; `Runtime.lookupField?` is a
  DIFFERENT operation, deliberately NOT shared across the seam.
- **`Eval.DefDeferral` carve — DONE (PB-1, 2026-07-02).** The trigger FIRED at 4609 lines;
  carved into `EvalBase → EvalDefer → Eval`. The core-force `mutual` block is NEVER split (its
  `termination_by (fuel, tag, length)` cannot cross a module boundary), so the carve bought FILE
  headroom via the lower `EvalBase` layer, not mutual-block headroom.
- **`resolveDefField?` skeleton-share — RULED OUT (Phase-B 2026-06-23).** The ~6
  def-resolution functions return structurally different things from the same lookup,
  gated differently, and the FRAME each captures is load-bearing and irreducibly
  different (the `crosspkg_defofdef_wrongframe_witness` hazard). KEEP SEPARATE.
- **inject-family DRY (`injectEmbedSiblingNarrowings` vs `injectLetLocalNarrowings`) —
  RULED OUT (Phase-B 2026-06-23).** The nested-`let` recursion DISPATCHES TO A DIFFERENT
  WALKER by design (embed→let, gated on `letPromotedReadLabels`) — a combinator
  parameterized on the read-labels leaf would change the milestone splice's gating, a
  soundness change. KEEP SEPARATE.
- **`mergeFieldsWith` consolidation — RULED OUT (Phase-B 2026-06-23).**
  `mergeFieldListWith` ↔ `mergeConjFields` already share `mergeFieldIntoWith`;
  `canonicalizeFields` cannot join under a `Value→Value→Value` combiner (it dispatches on
  merged field-class) and MUST not: the within-operand-union vs cross-operand-meet
  distinction lives in WHICH function the caller invokes (the Bug2-8 hazard). KEEP SEPARATE.
- **close-each vs close-once (Bug2-12 flatten path vs Bug2-7 conj-fold path) — RULED:
  SHARED PRIMITIVE, DISTINCT SEAMS.** Both defects are fixed by the ONE close-once
  primitive `mergeDefinitionDecls`; the two call contexts are genuinely distinct seams and
  merging the functions is forbidden by the `mergeFieldsWith` ruling.
- **`embedChainAny` (embed-chain walker share) — RULED: SHARE, applied `0619097`.**
  `bodyNeedsDefer`/`embedBodyEmbedsDisjDeep` differ only in a PURE non-recursive leaf
  predicate the combinator owns; the recursion stays lexically in the combinator, so
  `termination_by fuel` infers unchanged — the AD4-1 shape, NOT the DRY-1 trap.
- **CARRIER share/no-share (`.embeddedScalar` vs `.embeddedList`) — RULED (Phase-B
  2026-06-22): keep DISTINCT constructors** (a merged carrier would force runtime
  scalar-vs-list re-discrimination at every output/iteration site); do NOT share the meet
  seam (3-callback combinator = lambda-hides-`fuel+1`); DO share only the decl-selection
  seam (CARRIER-DECL-SELECT, done).
- **Escape-helper "duplication" (`escapeJsonChar` vs `escapeCueStringChar`) — NOT A
  FINDING (Phase-B 2026-06-22).** Five trivial shared arms; the substance diverges (JSON
  control-char escaping vs CUE verbatim). Keep separate.
- **AD2-1 (disjunction-normalizer lone-arm rule) — RESOLVED 2026-06-21, UNIFIED.** A
  lone default `*v` is VACUOUS (value-identical to bare `v` in every onward meet);
  `normalizeDisj`'s lone-arm collapse is now mark-agnostic; SC-3's "keep marked" display
  contract narrowed to MULTI-arm defaults.
- **DRY-1 (let-walker dedup) — RULED OUT (attempted, reverted).** The three let-walkers
  share no combinator — different carriers/visited-sets/follow-mechanisms, and routing
  the nested-let recursion through a callback breaks structural-recursion inference (the
  lambda-hides-`fuel+1` trap). Do not re-file unless a catamorphic 4th walker lands.
- **BI-EFF (effectful-builtin seam) — trigger standing.** `list.Sort`/`SortStable` are
  the only effectful builtins, one inline `runSort` case in `Eval`. Extract a named
  `evalEffectfulBuiltin?` seam AS THE FIRST STEP of the slice that lands the SECOND
  effectful builtin; a name→closure registry is rejected (less traceable than a `match`).
- **F-CASE-ARCH — RULED; both halves discharged.** The generated `Kue/CaseTable.lean`
  STAYS committed (reproducible, reviewable, offline build); oracle-as-data-source is an
  ADR ([`../decisions/2026-06-20-oracle-as-data-source.md`](../decisions/2026-06-20-oracle-as-data-source.md)):
  oracle = sound DATA SOURCE for an externally-standardized domain, NEVER a correctness gate.
- **FOUR-parallel-classifiers DRY — RE-RULED at four: keep SEPARATE.** They disagree on
  the partition (`.prim`/`.struct`/`.disj`/`.structComp` land differently per classifier);
  only the shared default-collapse pre-step was extracted (`collapseDefaultDisjunction`).
  Do not re-raise at five.
- **AD3-1 / Regex extraction — DROPPED (stale).** `Kue/Regex.lean` is already a verified
  true leaf; the NFA rebuild superseded the framing.
- **AD3-4 (bottom-payload newtype) — RULED OUT (over-engineering).** The invariant is
  enforced by construction at every site; a `BottomValue` newtype would ripple for safety
  already bought.
- **`Order.lean` (subsumption) — DELIBERATE test-only oracle**, imported only by
  `Tests/*`; NOT dead code and NOT duplicated. Recorded so a future audit does not re-flag it.
