# Spec-conformance re-audit

A full re-examination of every `cue` -grounded behavioral decision in Kue against the
**CUE language spec** and **lattice first principles**, triggered by the 2026-06-19
reframe (`docs/guides/slice-loop.md` → "The CUE spec is the authority"). The slice loop
had drifted into byte-identical-to-`cue`-v0.16.1 as the correctness gate — structurally
bug-replicating. This audit reclassifies what is actually correct vs. what merely matches
a fallible binary.

Feature slices are PAUSED until the high-risk areas are reclassified; findings here become
the spec-first fix-slice backlog in `plan.md`.

## Authority hierarchy (the gate)

1. **CUE language spec** — authoritative where it speaks; match it even against the
   binary.
2. **Lattice / first principles** — where the spec is silent (often): derive the
   mathematically-correct behavior (precise, total, illegal-states-unrepresentable).
3. **`cue` binary** — fallible cross-check ONLY. Never the gate.

## Classification taxonomy (every behavior gets one verdict)

- **CONFORMS** — spec speaks, Kue matches it (and `cue` does too). No action.
- **KUE-VIOLATES** — spec speaks, Kue is wrong (often because it matched a `cue` bug). FIX
  (spec-first fix-slice). Highest priority.
- **CUE-BUG / KUE-CORRECT** — spec speaks, `cue` is wrong, Kue follows the spec. Record in
  `cue-divergences.md`. No code action (already correct).
- **SPEC-SILENT / LATTICE-DERIVED** — spec silent, Kue's behavior is derivable as
  lattice-correct from first principles. Record the derivation; low risk.
- **SPEC-SILENT / SUSPECT-ARTIFACT** — spec silent, Kue's behavior only matches what the
  binary does and is NOT derivable (or contradicts) first principles. The danger zone:
  record in `cue-spec-gaps.md`, decide the principled behavior, FIX if it differs.

## Area decomposition (audited in risk order)

- **A. Disjunctions, defaults, narrowing** — default-mark algebra, resolution order,
  nested precedence, dedup, embedded-default narrowing, disjunction-arm pruning +
  structural discrimination (the argocd Gap-1/2/2b territory). HIGHEST risk — most `cue`
  -grounded.
- **B. Closedness & definitions** — open/closed, `...`, `#Def`, def-body closedness, the
  B6 cluster, `importBinding` /hidden-field laziness, closed-meet.
- **C. Structs & lists** — meet, patterns, tail (the B2 `mergeStructN` matrix + B2.5
  cross-combinations), list meet, embeddings, scalar-embed collapse.
- **D. Comprehensions, references, scoping** — comprehension guards/sources/scoping, frame
  resolution, closures, cross-package def-meet.
- **E. Scalars, bounds, kinds, regex, arithmetic, builtins** — the "basic" lattice (likely
  CONFORMS, but verify cue-correctness, esp. bounds intersection + numeric/decimal).
- **F. Manifest/export & module/import semantics** — what errors vs. tolerates,
  hidden-field bottom propagation, field ordering (#3), incomplete-vs-error, cross-module
  resolution.

## Audit history (archived — full detail in implementation-log.md + git)

Completed findings and shipped design specs, compressed to pointers. Each cites the
landing commit; the as-built detail lives in `docs/reference/implementation-log.md` and
git history.

- 2026-06-19 — `d9f66ca` — **Bug2-3 / Gap-2b** structural list-arm-vs-struct-host
  disjunction pruning (gated `embedBodyEmbedsDisj` /`spliceOperandForEmbed`; cert-manager
  byte-identical; 4 soundness obligations verified; cue correct, Kue was under-pruning).
- 2026-06-19 — `3f7a761` — **Bug2-4** let-LOCAL declare-and-read narrowing
  (`letPromotedReadLabels` + `injectLetLocalNarrowings`, both total + axiom-clean; minimal
  Mixin repro content-identical to cue; surfaced the residual Bug2-5 argocd blocker).
- 2026-06-19 — `2ab5c84..3725444` — Phase-A audit of the Bug2-3 + Bug2-4 batch (both
  spec-correct + sound; CLI-vs-harness divergence reconciled BENIGN; filed DRY-1 — see
  backlog).
- 2026-06-19 — `5d884af..e4922c9` — Phase-A audit of the RX-2b + RX-1c batch (both
  spec-correct; recategorized the RX-2b field-less invalid-label entry to a spec gap;
  added 3 newline regression pins; RX-2c noted already DONE).
- 2026-06-19 — `a5862df..04eb7de` — Phase-A audit of the SC-2 + RX-1a + RX-1b batch (RE2
  engine RE2-correct beyond the 7 repros, 1 corpus divergence = RX-2a; SC-2 no over-close;
  filed RX-2a/RX-2b/RX-2c/SC-4 — see backlog).
- 2026-06-19 — `4358a7e` — Phase-B whole-graph sweep (post regex-trilogy; module graph
  healthy; Bug2-3 + D#2 designs RE-VERIFIED GO no drift; produced the #4 re-rank below).
- 2026-06-19 — `659cf70` — Phase-B whole-graph sweep (D#2-spike audit; Regex leaf
  exemplary; RX-2b soundness hole resolved across 5 sites; perf-guide currency fixed
  inline).
- 2026-06-19 — Batch 1 (areas A, B, C) complete — SC-1/SC-2/SC-3 + Gap-2b +
  vindicated-correct catalog + spec gaps (import laziness, `A|B` form, field order #3).
- 2026-06-19 — Batch 2 (areas D, E, F) complete — D#1–D#7, RX-1, BI-1/BI-2, F-1–F-5
  findings; numeric/bounds/division/decimal CONFORMS.
- 2026-06-19 — `df10043..ae63b8a` — Phase-A audit of the SC-1d + F-2 batch (both
  spec-correct, DRY, all consumers covered; SC-1d surfaced the nested-closedness bug
  folded into SC-2).
- 2026-06-19 — RX-1a/RX-1b/RX-1c — regex trilogy SHIPPED (`Kue/Regex.lean` RE2-equivalent
  parse → Thompson compile → Pike-VM; submatch + `ReplaceAll` /`Find*` via the capture
  array; 4 dispatch sites rewired; old `Value.lean` backtracking block deleted; totality
  argument replaces the prior fuel-as-truncation soundness hole). Remaining regex work:
  RX-2a (below).
- 2026-06-19 — SC-2 SHIPPED — nested def-body closedness closed at the FIRST meet via the
  `normalizeDefinitionFieldWithFuel` CLOSING twin (Normalize-only; SC-2a cue-agrees, SC-2b
  diverges and is recorded in `cue-divergences.md`; `importBinding` /`letBinding`/hidden
  trap arms untouched). Was the last open closedness HIGH.

## Consolidated fix backlog (re-audit COMPLETE — spec-first, ranked)

Feature work resumes here, spec-first. Ranked by severity; contained high-confidence fixes
front-loaded before the large rewrites. **This section owns the single authoritative
ranked backlog.** The ranking is Phase-B audit #4 (below); the detailed live-slice entries
follow it.

### Re-ranked next slices (2026-06-19 Phase-B audit #4 — regex trilogy COMPLETE; SC-2 landed)

Re-rank after the full regex family (RX-1a/b/c, RX-2b/2c) + SC-2 landed and were
Phase-A-verified clean (`4358a7e`). The two designed HIGH levers (Bug2-3, D#2) RE-VERIFIED
GO against the post-SC-2 tree this audit (line-refs drifted ±40 but structures + reuse
targets intact). Principle (slice-loop, reaffirmed 2026-06-20): rank by **spec-correctness
and clean design evolution** — contained-soundness before larger features; cue-AGREEING
correctness before divergence; designed levers before undesigned. Real-app compilation
(argocd, cert-manager) is a STRESS TEST, not a ranking driver: a blocker that needs
app-specific narrowing is parked (see Bug2-5), never promoted to the critical path — it
resolves as the general semantics mature. **Recommended next 3-4:**

1. **D#2a (HIGH — structural-cycle DETECTION, DESIGNED, slice 1 of 2).**
   Ancestor-force-stack on the `forceClosureWithConjunct` path (reusing the `ForceKey`
   triple). Lands oracle #1/#3/#4/#5 (error + finite-control + reference-control).
   Spec-mandated, currently MISSING. Design GO, no drift. Cannot regress real apps (zero
   self-ref defs in prod9).
2. **D#2b (HIGH — terminating-disjunct, DESIGNED, slice 2 of 2).** `#List | *null` takes
   the default arm once the cyclic arm bottoms (existing `liveAlternatives`
   /`resolveDisjDefault?` algebra). Folds in the A#6 `containsBottom` fuel-cap fix if it
   hides a deep cycle bottom.
3. **RX-2a (MED — in-class `\D` /`\W`/`\S`, the lone regex-corpus divergence).** Needs
   class-level set-complement folding in `parseClassEscape`. Sequence AFTER D#2 if D#2
   runs in a worktree — RX-2a and any future regex work both touch the Regex leaf, so
   serialize regex-module edits to avoid worktree contention. Lower than D#2 (feature, not
   a real-app blocker; current behavior is an honest stub, not silent-wrong).

(Recently landed, now in Audit history: Bug2-3/Gap-2b `d9f66ca`, Bug2-4 `3f7a761`. argocd
did not unblock — residual Bug2-5 is PARKED as a stress-test finding, see Live-slice
detail; it is not on the critical path.)

Then the MED tail (D#1b/D#1c, D#3 `let` -clauses, SC-3 disj-display, BI-1 Unicode
case-fold, BI-2 `math.Pow` /`list.Sort`, F-3 qualified import), SC-4 (LOW,
spec-gap-first), the 4 spec-gap ratifications in `cue-spec-gaps.md`, low/hardening (A#6
standalone if not folded into D#2b), DRY-1 (LOW refactor), and the **plan-hygiene slice
(schedule AFTER Bug2-3)**. RX-2c is DONE (mark it in the hygiene pass — `maxRepeat=1000`
landed with RX-1a).

### Live-slice detail (folded from prior re-ranks; DONE entries dropped to Audit history)

**Bug2-5 (HIGH — the single residual argocd export blocker, undesigned).**
`kue export apps/argocd.cue` still bottoms (~153s). Narrowing-injection into a
disjunction-arm-referenced let-local. The remaining shape, faithfully reproduced
(`/tmp/kue-ls-shape.cue`), is
`defaults.#ListenerSet = defs.#ListenerSet & parts.#UseCertManager & {…}`:
`defs.#ListenerSet` declares `kind: "ListenerSet"` at ITS def frame and CO-EMBEDS
`#UseCertManager` (→ `#Mixin`). The Mixin's `_patch.kind` must be narrowed by the SIBLING
def's `kind`, NOT by a use-operand. Because `#Mixin` 's body is the
`listShape | structShape | error` DISJUNCTION, the embed resolves on the `.disj` arm of
`meetEmbeddingsWithFuel` (each arm `meet` s the host AFTER the arm — and `_patch` 's
comprehension — has evaluated), so the narrowing arrives too late and
`injectLetLocalNarrowings` (which fires only on the `forceClosureWithConjunctCore`
`.structComp` arm) never runs. Minimal repro:
`#ListenerSet: { #UseCertManager; kind: "ListenerSet" }`,
`out: #ListenerSet & {#name:"x"}` → cue emits `meta:"yes"`, Kue drops it. **The fix:**
when an embedded disjunction's surviving arm (`structShape`) references a sibling let
(`_patch`) that declares-and-reads a label narrowed by a CO-EMBEDDING sibling def's static
field (`kind`), the `.disj` -distribution path of `meetEmbeddingsWithFuel` must inject
that narrowing into `_patch` BEFORE the arm's comprehension expands — the disjunction
analogue of Bug2-4's `injectLetLocalNarrowings` on the force path. A deeper mechanism than
read-label following. Pinned repro `/tmp/kue-ls-shape.cue`. (Note: CLI `kue export` and
the in-Lean `exportJsonMatches` harness reach DIFFERENT embed arms for the def-host Mixin
— both produce correct output, but the path divergence is a latent concern flagged for the
architecture audit. The Phase-A audit RECONCILED this as BENIGN for no-import single
sources — see Audit history `2ab5c84..3725444` — but the disj-arm path itself is the
Bug2-5 mechanism.)

**HIGH — soundness / real-app correctness (the LARGE designed levers):**

- **Bug2-3 / Gap-2b — DONE (2026-06-19, `d9f66ca`).** See Audit history.
- **D#2 (HIGH, LARGE — structural-cycle detection — DESIGNED).** `#L:{n,next:#L}` errors
  `structural cycle`; `#List | *null` terminates on the default arm. Spec-mandated,
  currently MISSING (unrolls fuel-deep to garbage). Detection = an ancestor force-stack
  (reusing the `ForceKey` triple as frame identity); terminating-arm = the EXISTING
  `liveAlternatives` /`resolveDisjDefault?` algebra once the cyclic arm bottoms. 2 slices
  (D#2a detection + D#2b terminating-disjunct). Cannot regress real apps (prod9 has ZERO
  recursive defs). See the "D#2 design (implementable)" section below.

**SC-1b (MED — soundness, pre-existing & broader than SC-1).** The `closingPatterns`
carry-forward is a UNION across conjuncts; for two CLOSED defs with DISJOINT explicit
fields but overlapping patterns (`#A:{a,[=~"^x"]} & #B:{b,[=~"^x"]}`), the correct forward
allowed-set is the INTERSECTION of the two (`out.a`/`out.b` rejected, `x1` admitted). The
union-store admits `a` /`b` on a LATER meet against the result (the at-this-meet marking
is correct via sequential closedness application; only the stored forward set is lossy).
cue rejects `a` /`b`; current Kue (both before and after SC-1) admits them. Needs an
intersection-aware closed allowed-set representation. Not introduced by SC-1 — SC-1 made
the pattern-vs-plain case correct; this is the closed×closed-pattern case. (Sits with the
MED tail — pre-existing, narrower than SC-1.)

**RX-2a (MED, needs set-complement).** Support `\D` /`\W`/`\S` INSIDE a `[…]` class (the
lone regex-corpus divergence). Needs class-level set complement (fold the negated perl
ranges into the class, or carry per-class negation of a sub-set) — `parseClassEscape` 's
current `.error` arms become real folds. RE2 feature; currently a correct stub. Sequence
after the capture work since both touch the regex module.

**SC-4 (LOW, spec-gap-first).** Hidden-field / let-bound-PLAIN-struct nested values do not
close on DIRECT def unification (`#A:{_h:{b:int}}; #A & {_h:{b,extra}}` and the let
analog) where cue closes. cue is INTERNALLY INCONSISTENT (direct-`&` closes,
select-then-`&` does not), so this is probably a cue eval-strategy artifact, not a spec
mandate. **Spec-check FIRST** (record in `cue-spec-gaps.md`); only then decide whether to
route these through the closing twin. Do NOT reflexively match cue. Lowest priority.
(Origin: SC-1-batch + SC-2 Phase-A under-close hunt; the SC-2 design deliberately routes
`letBinding` /hidden through the SPINE, correct for a let/hidden bound to a DEF — `c8b`
/`c4b` paths where Kue==cue==OPEN.)

**MED tail:**

9. **D#1b** incomplete-guard deferral (incomplete-deferral half of the D#1 guard
   catch-all; couples with D#2 structural cycles). The guard match currently has
   `.bool true` → continue, `.bool false` → drop, `.bottom` /`.bottomWith` → propagate
   (D#1a, DONE), residual `_` → `[]`; D#1b makes the genuinely incomplete/abstract guard
   DEFER rather than drop.
10. **D#1c (MED — found in the SC-1-batch Phase-A audit).** The guard's residual
    `_ => pure (.ok [])` arm still SWALLOWS a CONCRETE non-bool guard, which the spec
    treats as a type error, not a drop: `if "x" {…}` / `if 3 {…}` yield `{}` in Kue but
    `cue` errors (`cannot use "x" (type string) as type bool`). D#1a fixed the bottom case
    and D#1b owns the INCOMPLETE (abstract) case (legitimately defers), but the residual
    arm conflates "incomplete abstract → defer" with "concrete non-bool → error". The fix
    splits them: a concrete value whose kind is not `bool` is a `.bottomWith` type error
    (propagate, like the bottom case); only a genuinely incomplete/abstract guard defers
    (D#1b). Couples with D#1b's deferral classification. `Eval.lean`
    `expandClausesWithFuel` guard match.
11. **D#3** `let` clauses in comprehensions (parse + `Clause.letClause` + wire `let` =+1
    in `descendClauses`). The for=+1/if=+0 frame model is spec-CORRECT (B7 vindicated);
    `let` must wire as +1 when this lands.
12. **SC-3 (LOW-MED — disjunction eval display/normalization).** `normalizeEvaluatedDisj`
    (`Eval.lean:648`) only flattens/dedups the all-regular case; a marked-default or
    nested `.disj` arm is emitted raw → `eval` display + structural `.disj` equality
    diverge (`*1|*1|2` shows raw, cue → `1`). Values stay correct (`export`/arithmetic
    force `resolveDisjDefault?`). Fix: apply `liveAlternatives`
    (flatten/drop-bottom/dedup) in the non-all-regular branch.
13. **BI-1 (MED)** Unicode case folding for `strings.ToUpper/ToLower` (currently
    ASCII-only; cue full-Unicode → wrong answers).
14. **BI-2 (MED)** implement `math.Pow/Sqrt`, `list.Sort/SortStable` (currently bottom on
    concrete input — deferred builtins).
15. **F-3 (MED)** parse qualified import path `"location:identifier"` (currently unparsed;
    latent).

**Spec-gap decisions (record + ratify in `cue-spec-gaps.md`, mostly doc) — the 4
ratifications:** import-binding laziness (B#2/F-5 — keep, operational basis; smell:
reference-location-dependent, includes the RX-2b field-less-invalid-label entry
recategorized here); incomplete `A|B` form for un-narrowed struct-arm disjunctions (A —
keep open; lattice-defensible: a join with no unique default); field order #3 (C/F-4 —
keep Kue's principled source-order, stop gating on cue's order); list `+` /`*` removed in
cue v0.11 (E#4 — decide hard-error vs residual; Kue currently leaves a residual). All
current gaps already in `cue-spec-gaps.md`.

**Low / hardening:** `containsBottom` fuel cap 100 (**A#6** — `Lattice.lean:146`; a bottom
> 100 levels deep escapes pruning → wrong value, not just slow; a partiality hole. Fold
> into
D#2b if it hides a deep `structuralCycle` bottom; otherwise standalone); `{#a:1,5}`
scalar-embed-with-definitions coverage gap; D#1b incomplete-guard deferral (couples with
D#2).

**DRY-1 (LOW Phase-B refactor, no behavior change).** Extract a shared `walkFollowedLets`
(visited-set + fuel + `.structComp` /`.struct` destructure) combinator and refactor
`closeDefFrameReadIndices` (collects `List Nat` indices), `letPromotedReadLabels`
(collects `List String` labels), `injectLetLocalNarrowings` (rewrites → `Value`) onto it —
the `seen.contains` /fuel-decrement/`.structComp`-vs-`.struct` destructure is copied ~3×.
The COMPOSERS (`embedComprehensionReadLabels`, `embedDisjArmDeclLabels`,
`embedBodyEmbedsDisj`, `spliceOperandForEmbed`) are NOT duplicative — each encodes a
distinct CUE rule. Pure cleanup; gate on byte-identical fixtures + axiom-clean. **Schedule
after Bug2-5** (which adds a 4th walker on the disj path — fold it into the same
combinator in one pass rather than refactoring twice).

**Plan-hygiene slice (non-code, schedule AFTER Bug2-3 lands).** `plan.md` and this audit
doc have accumulated superseded re-ranks, completed Phase-A write-ups, and resolved
fix-slice diagnoses. A hygiene pass distills the backlog to the LIVE open set + North Star
+ standing capabilities, moves DONE entries to `implementation-log.md` /git, and marks
RX-2c DONE (`maxRepeat=1000` landed with RX-1a). `docs/www/index.html` is CURRENT — leave
it.

**Spec-doc errors (cosmetic, no code action):** the CUE spec's disjunction worked-example
comments contradict its own U2 rule (cue + Kue both follow the rule); the
`2 & >=1.0 & <3.0` example is stale. No action.

## D#2 design (implementable) — structural-cycle detection

**Status (2026-06-19, Phase-B spike):** designed, ready to slice. Oracle ground truth
built; the detection lever, the terminating-disjunct handling, the soundness/totality
argument, and the slice plan follow. This is the remaining large structural gap (D#2,
HIGH, spec-mandated, currently MISSING).

### Spec basis (the gate — RE2-style, quote the spec)

The CUE spec mandates dynamic detection: *"Implementations should be able to detect such
structural cycles dynamically."* The validity rule it sets up: *"a node is valid if any of
its conjuncts is not cyclic"* — i.e. a structural cycle is an error UNLESS a conjunct/arm
provides a non-cyclic (terminating) value. So `#L: {n:int, next:#L}` (the sole conjunct is
cyclic) is a `structural cycle` error, while `#List: {head:_, tail: #List | *null}` is
valid — the disjunction's `*null` arm is a non-cyclic conjunct, so the node terminates by
taking it. This is NOT a perf concern routed through the fuel backstop; it is a
spec-mandated *value* (error vs terminated-struct), and the fuel bound must NOT be the
thing that fires.

### Oracle ground truth (cue v0.16.1, all probes run; `/Users/chakrit/go/bin/cue`)

The differentiator between #1 (error) and #5 (`_`): #5 is a REFERENCE cycle (`x` resolves
to itself with no struct between) handled by the depth-0 `visited` -slot check
(`Eval.lean:2342-2347`, returns `.top`); #1 is a STRUCTURAL cycle (a def body whose field
re-enters the same def through a struct layer) handled by the def-closure FORCE path
(`refDefClosureBody?` → `forceClosureWithConjunct`), which currently has NO cycle
tracking. The two are distinct mechanisms; D#2 adds the second without disturbing the
first.

### Root cause (single, in the def-body force path)

A `#Def` whose body needs deferral (`refDefClosureBody?` fires for a nested `depth>0`
self-ref `.struct`, oracle #1's `next: #L`) forces via
`forceClosureWithConjunct fuel (frame::outer) defBody []` (`Eval.lean:2331`). Forcing
evaluates the body's fields (`evalFieldRefsListWithFuel`, the `.struct` arm at
`Eval.lean:2898-2905`); the field `next:#L` is a `.refId` back to `#L`, re-enters the
`.refId` arm (`Eval.lean:2314`), hits `refDefClosureBody?` AGAIN, and re-forces the SAME
`(capturedEnv.ids, body)` one fuel tier down — recursing until `fuel = 0` truncates to
`{..., ...}`. The depth-0 `visited` -slot check (line 2342) is structurally BYPASSED: the
closure-force fork at line 2330 returns before the `visited` branch is ever reached. So
there is no ancestor memory on the force path at all.

### The ancestor identity is ALREADY computed — `ForceKey` minus fuel

The sound ancestor identity falls out of existing machinery. `forceClosureWithConjunct`
already keys its memo on `ForceKey = ⟨fuel, capturedEnv.ids, body, useOperands⟩`
(`Eval.lean:1418`). The fuel-free triple `(capturedEnv.ids, body, useOperands)` is EXACTLY
"this def-frame being expanded": `capturedEnv.ids` is the canonical frame-id stack
(frame-sharing canonicalizes it — `pushFrame` /`FrameKey`), `body` is the normalized def
body (closed-vs-open already baked in), `useOperands` is the narrowing. Two forces with
the same triple ARE the same def-frame expansion at different fuel — a structural cycle is
precisely a re-entry of an in-progress triple. So "ancestor" is identified soundly as
**the set of `(envIds, body, useOperands)` triples currently on the force stack** — no new
identity scheme, reusing the proven `ForceKey` soundness argument (the id stack is a
canonical proxy for frame contents).

### Detection lever — an ancestor-frame stack threaded through the force path

Add an ancestor stack to `EvalM` state (or thread it as a parameter — see "Representation"
below): `forceStack : List ForceFrameId` where
`ForceFrameId = (List Nat × Value × List (List Field × Bool))` is the fuel-free force
triple. `forceClosureWithConjunct`:

1. Compute `frameId := (capturedEnv.ids, body, useOperands)`.
2. **If `frameId ∈ forceStack` ** → this force re-enters an in-progress ancestor = a
   structural cycle. Return `.bottomWith [.structuralCycle]` (new `BottomReason` arm) for
   THIS expansion — do NOT recurse. (The "any conjunct not cyclic" rule is handled at the
   disjunction layer, below; a bare cyclic conjunct with no terminating arm surfaces this
   bottom.)
3. **Else** push `frameId`, recurse (`forceClosureWithConjunctCore`), pop on return.

This fires BEFORE fuel exhaustion: the second re-entry of `#L` (depth-2) is already an
ancestor hit, so detection happens at recursion depth ~2, not at `fuel = 0`. The fuel
bound stays as the backstop for genuinely-unbounded NON-cyclic growth (which a finite spec
program never has), but a true structural cycle NEVER reaches it. Place the check at the
single `forceClosureWithConjunct` entry (not `…Core`) so the memo-hit fast-path and the
cycle check share one gate; the memo and the cycle stack are orthogonal (a memo hit is a
*completed* force, never an in-progress one — a completed force has been popped, so a memo
hit can never be a false cycle positive).

**Why the force triple and not the slot index** (contrast with `visited`): the `visited`
set is slot indices within ONE frame — correct for same-frame reference cycles (#5),
useless across def-body expansions (each force pushes a fresh frame). The force triple
spans frames, which is what a structural cycle needs (#1's re-entry is a NEW frame with
the same canonical id-stack + body). Mutual recursion (#3, `#A` →`#B`→`#A`) works for
free: `#A` 's force triple re-enters the stack two hops down, same mechanism — no special
mutual-cycle code.

### The terminating-disjunct case (#2 — `#List | *null`)

`tail: #List | *null` must take the `*null` arm rather than unroll the cyclic `#List` arm.
The spec rule — *"a node is valid if any of its conjuncts is not cyclic"* — means: when
forcing a disjunction arm that turns out structurally-cyclic, that arm becomes
`.bottomWith [.structuralCycle]`, and the EXISTING disjunction algebra prunes it. The
mechanism already exists and needs only the cyclic arm to bottom:

- `liveAlternatives` (`Lattice.lean:266`) filters arms via `containsBottom` — a
  `.structuralCycle` bottom arm is dropped exactly like any other bottom arm.
- `resolveDisjDefault?` (`Lattice.lean:285`) then resolves: with the cyclic `#List` arm
  pruned, the surviving `*null` default wins → `tail: null`. The default-mark algebra is
  UNTOUCHED; the cyclic arm simply never survives to compete.

The ORDER subtlety the spike flags: the arms must be evaluated such that the cyclic arm's
re-entry bottoms it BEFORE `resolveDisjDefault?` runs — which is automatic, because
forcing each arm is what triggers the ancestor-stack hit, and `liveAlternatives`
/`resolveDisjDefault?` run on the already-forced arm values. The disjunction-distribution
path (`splitDisjConjunct`, `Eval.lean:2361`) and the `.disj` -arm force already evaluate
arms independently; the cyclic arm under the SAME force-stack ancestor bottoms, the
default arm does not. **No new default-resolution code** — D#2's terminating-arm handling
IS the existing default algebra, once the cyclic arm carries a `structuralCycle` bottom.
This is the same shape as D#1a (a bottom that must PROPAGATE through the
comprehension/disjunction algebra rather than vanish).

⚠ One probe the slice MUST run: confirm `*null` is reached. The current code
force-recurses the `#List` arm via `refDefClosureBody?` on `next` /`tail` — once that arm
bottoms on the ancestor hit, verify `liveAlternatives` sees the bottom (it calls
`containsBottom`, which must reach a nested `.structuralCycle` — check `containsBottom` 's
fuel cap A#6, the 100-level limit, does not hide a deep structural-cycle bottom; if it
can, raise it or special-case `.structuralCycle`).

### Soundness + totality (gate)

Three obligations, each discharged by the lever's structure:

1. **No false-positive on finite-deep non-recursive nesting** (oracle #4,
   `#D:{a:{b:{c:{d}}}}`). Each nested struct `a` /`b`/`c` has a DISTINCT force triple
   (different `body`, different `envIds`) — none re-enters an ancestor, so no
   `structuralCycle` fires. The depth is bounded by the program's finite AST; the force
   stack grows to AST depth and pops cleanly. ✓
2. **No interference with reference cycles** (oracle #5, `x:x`). The `visited` -slot check
   (line 2342) is on the NON-closure `.refId` path; `x:x` never reaches
   `refDefClosureBody?` (a bare self-ref with no struct body to defer → `none` from
   `refDefClosureBody?`, falls to the `visited` branch). The force stack is only pushed on
   the closure path. The two mechanisms are disjoint by construction. ✓ (Pin a
   `native_decide`: `x:x` still → `.top` /`_`.)
3. **Totality** — the force stack is a `List` that grows by one push per force-recursion
   and is bounded: either a triple repeats (→ cycle bottom, no further recursion) or every
   triple is distinct (→ bounded by the finite set of `(envIds, body, useOperands)`
   reachable from the program, which is finite since the AST is finite and `envIds` are
   drawn from the finite frame table). So the recursion terminates BY the cycle check,
   independent of fuel — fuel becomes a pure backstop, never the deciding bound for a
   cyclic program. No new `partial`; the `termination_by (fuel, 5, 0)` measure is
   unchanged (the check is a `List.contains` guard before the recursive call, not a new
   recursion). ✓

**Representation choice (illegal-states / repo philosophy):** thread the ancestor stack as
an EXPLICIT parameter to `forceClosureWithConjunct` /`…Core` (and the few force call
sites), NOT as mutable `EvalState`. A parameter is lexically scoped to the live recursion
— it cannot leak a stale ancestor across sibling forces (a mutable field would need
careful push/pop discipline that a future edit could break; the parameter makes the scope
structural). This mirrors the `visited : List Nat` parameter already threaded through
`evalValueWithFuel` — same pattern, same rationale (the slice loop's "encode intent in the
type/scope, not a flag"). The force-memo (`ForceKey`) is independent and unchanged: a memo
hit serves a COMPLETED (popped) force, never an in-progress ancestor, so the cycle stack
and the memo never alias. ⚠ Memo interaction to verify in the slice: a `structuralCycle`
bottom result must be keyed/cached correctly — it is a genuine saturated value (not a fuel
truncation), so it caches in `satCache` like any bottom; confirm the bottom is not
re-derived per fuel level (it should be `saturated`).

### New `BottomReason` arm + gate

Add `BottomReason.structuralCycle` (parameterize with the def label/path if cheap, for a
spec-shaped message like `#L.next: structural cycle`; a bare arm is acceptable for v1).
Wire its display in `Format` /`Manifest` (the standard bottom-reason rendering path).
**Gate:** byte-identical on ALL existing fixtures EXCEPT the new D#2 repros (which now
error/terminate correctly); cert-manager/argocd content-identical (re-probe READ-ONLY) —
and they CANNOT regress: a read-only sweep of `prod9/infra` (27 `.cue` files) found ZERO
self-referential definitions, so no real-app shape reaches the ancestor-hit path.
Detection fires only on a true ancestor re-entry, which the apps never trigger.

### Fixtures + pins

- **NEW (error cases):** `comprehensions/structural_cycle_struct` (#1, `#L:{n,next:#L}` →
  `next: _|_ structuralCycle`), `…/structural_cycle_mutual` (#3, `#A` /`#B` mutual). Each
  with a `FixturePorts` entry. (Note: the `.expected` records Kue's spec-correct ERROR,
  matching cue's `structural cycle` — record as CONFORMS, both error.)
- **NEW (terminating case):** `comprehensions/structural_cycle_terminating_default` (#2,
  `#List | *null` → `tail: null`), the spec's headline "valid if any conjunct not cyclic"
  case.
- **Controls (keep green):** a finite-deep struct fixture (#4 — must NOT bottom; add
  `…/deep_finite_struct_no_cycle` if not already covered), and `x:x` (#5 — reference cycle
  still `_`, an existing fixture).
- **`native_decide` pins:** `#L` self-ref → `structuralCycle` bottom at `next`;
  `#List | *null` → `tail` resolves to `null`; finite-deep → no bottom; `x:x` → `.top`
  (reference path untouched); mutual `#A` /`#B` → bottom.

### Slice plan (2 slices; worktree optional)

Splittable at a clean internal seam:

- **D#2a — detection (the error case).** Add `BottomReason.structuralCycle`; thread the
  ancestor force-stack parameter through `forceClosureWithConjunct` /`…Core` + its call
  sites; fire the cycle bottom on an ancestor hit. Wire bottom-reason display. Lands
  oracle #1/#3/#4/#5 (error + finite-control + reference-control). Gate: the two error
  fixtures + the two controls. Checkpoint-commit when green.
- **D#2b — the terminating-disjunct case.** Verify `liveAlternatives`
  /`resolveDisjDefault?` prune the cyclic arm and take `*null` (oracle #2); fix
  `containsBottom` 's fuel cap (A#6) if it hides a deep `structuralCycle` bottom (this
  couples D#2 with the A#6 hardening item — fold it in here if it blocks #2). Lands the
  `#List | *null` terminating fixture + pin.

**Couples with D#1b** (incomplete-guard deferral) only loosely — both touch
bottom-propagation through the disjunction/comprehension algebra, but D#2's bottom is a
CONCRETE structural-cycle error (propagate), not an incomplete deferral. Do D#2
standalone; D#1b can follow.

**Worktree: optional.** D#2a touches `Eval.lean` (the hot module) + `Value.lean`
(`BottomReason`) + `Format` /`Manifest` (display) — a focused multi-file change but not
the large churn RX-1b had. A worktree is reasonable if RX-1c/Bug2-3 are running
concurrently; otherwise `main` is fine (the change is additive — a new bottom arm + a
guard, no deletion of a hot block). Estimate: **2 slices**, contained.
