# Spec-conformance re-audit

A full re-examination of every `cue` -grounded behavioral decision in Kue against the
**CUE language spec** and **lattice first principles**, triggered by the 2026-06-19
reframe (`docs/guides/slice-loop.md` → "The CUE spec is the authority"). The slice loop
had drifted into byte-identical-to-`cue`-v0.16.1 as the correctness gate — structurally
bug-replicating. This audit reclassifies what is actually correct vs. what merely matches
a fallible binary.

Feature slices are PAUSED until the high-risk areas are reclassified; findings here become
the spec-first fix-slice backlog in `plan.md`.

## Authority hierarchy (the gate)

1. **CUE language spec** — authoritative where it speaks; match it even against the
   binary.
2. **Lattice / first principles** — where the spec is silent (often): derive the
   mathematically-correct behavior (precise, total, illegal-states-unrepresentable).
3. **`cue` binary** — fallible cross-check ONLY. Never the gate.

## Classification taxonomy (every behavior gets one verdict)

- **CONFORMS** — spec speaks, Kue matches it (and `cue` does too). No action.
- **KUE-VIOLATES** — spec speaks, Kue is wrong (often because it matched a `cue` bug). FIX
  (spec-first fix-slice). Highest priority.
- **CUE-BUG / KUE-CORRECT** — spec speaks, `cue` is wrong, Kue follows the spec. Record in
  `cue-divergences.md`. No code action (already correct).
- **SPEC-SILENT / LATTICE-DERIVED** — spec silent, Kue's behavior is derivable as
  lattice-correct from first principles. Record the derivation; low risk.
- **SPEC-SILENT / SUSPECT-ARTIFACT** — spec silent, Kue's behavior only matches what the
  binary does and is NOT derivable (or contradicts) first principles. The danger zone:
  record in `cue-spec-gaps.md`, decide the principled behavior, FIX if it differs.

## Area decomposition (audited in risk order)

- **A. Disjunctions, defaults, narrowing** — default-mark algebra, resolution order,
  nested precedence, dedup, embedded-default narrowing, disjunction-arm pruning +
  structural discrimination (the argocd Gap-1/2/2b territory). HIGHEST risk — most `cue`
  -grounded.
- **B. Closedness & definitions** — open/closed, `...`, `#Def`, def-body closedness, the
  B6 cluster, `importBinding` /hidden-field laziness, closed-meet.
- **C. Structs & lists** — meet, patterns, tail (the B2 `mergeStructN` matrix + B2.5
  cross-combinations), list meet, embeddings, scalar-embed collapse.
- **D. Comprehensions, references, scoping** — comprehension guards/sources/scoping, frame
  resolution, closures, cross-package def-meet.
- **E. Scalars, bounds, kinds, regex, arithmetic, builtins** — the "basic" lattice (likely
  CONFORMS, but verify cue-correctness, esp. bounds intersection + numeric/decimal).
- **F. Manifest/export & module/import semantics** — what errors vs. tolerates,
  hidden-field bottom propagation, field ordering (#3), incomplete-vs-error, cross-module
  resolution.

## Audit history (archived — full detail in implementation-log.md + git)

Completed findings and shipped design specs, compressed to pointers. Each cites the
landing commit; the as-built detail lives in `docs/reference/implementation-log.md` and
git history.

- 2026-06-20 — **D#3** `let` clauses in comprehensions — the LAST open D-area item, now
  CLOSED. `Clause.letClause (name, value)` added to the comprehension clause sum
  (`Value.lean`, total, no catch-all); `descendClauses` `.letClause` arm routes the value
  through `onSource` + pushes +1, so `clauseChainDepth` + all 4 walkers handle it for
  free. Frame model: `let` = +1 (spec: *"`for` and `let` clauses each define a new
  scope"*; `if` = +0). Parse: `parseLetClause` (`dropWord?`-bounded), wired into
  `parseClause` after `for` /`if`; reached only inside a clause chain, so a
  struct-field-head `let` stays a struct-body binding (spec `StartClause` excludes `let`).
  Eval: bind the EVALUATED value into a one-slot frame like a `for` element (`loopFrame
  none.top name`), alignment-correct; an unreferenced binding's bottom sits unread
  (matches cue for value-level bottoms). All 8 clause-match sites updated explicitly. 9
  `native_decide` pins (incl. the `for` -after-`let` frame-accounting + shadowing cases) +
  6 fixtures (list + struct forms); cert-manager content-identical. 1 cue-divergence
  (unreferenced unresolved-ref `let` — cue errors, Kue tolerates) + 1 spec-gap
  (eval-order/eager-into-frame). See implementation-log 2026-06-20.
- 2026-06-20 — **D#1b + D#1c** comprehension-guard classification (`Eval.lean`: new total
  `classifyGuard` over a `GuardVerdict` sum, enumerating every `Value` — no catch-all —
  read by both clause-walkers; `Value.lean`: `NonBoolGuardType` +
  `BottomReason.nonBoolGuard`). D#1c concrete-non-bool→type-error (CONFORMS); D#1b
  incomplete→defer (keeps the comprehension residual via the new `ClauseExpansion`
  /`ListClauseExpansion` `deferred` outcome + `withDeferredComprehensions` re-wrap;
  spec-gap + display divergence recorded). The residual presence-test shape `X !=/== _|_`
  is carved out (stays a drop). Guard catch-all fully drained (D#1a/b/c all DONE). 17
  `native_decide` pins + 4 fixtures; 3 bug-replicating drop-pins corrected to the held
  form; cert-manager content-identical. See implementation-log 2026-06-20.
- 2026-06-20 — **RX-2a** in-class negated shorthand classes (`Regex.lean`
  `parseClassEscape` 's `\D` /`\W`/`\S` `.error` arms → `complementRanges` folds; new
  total `Regex.complementRanges` + `maxCodePoint` over the `[0, U+10FFFF]` `Char` domain).
  The lone regex-corpus divergence; CONFORMS (RE2-mandated, cue-agreeing). Representation:
  NO new AST state — `cls ranges negated` already precise, the complement is a range union
  that composes through the ordinary union and is flipped by the whole-class `negated`
  flag for `[^…]`. 26 `native_decide` pins + the `numeric/regex_in_class_negated` `=~`
  /`!~` fixture. The regex corpus is now divergence-free (RX-1 trilogy + RX-2a/b/c all
  DONE).
- 2026-06-20 — **D#2b** terminating-disjunct (`Eval.lean` `normalizeEvaluatedDisj` now
  applies `liveAlternatives` on the has-default branch). Completes D#2: `#List | *null`
  terminates on `*null` (`tail: null`, cue-byte-identical). Re-diagnosis: VALUE resolution
  was already correct after D#2a (`export` via `resolveDisjDefault?`); the A#6 fuel cap
  was never implicated (detection at depth ~2 ⇒ shallow bottom); the gap was the EVAL
  value path emitting defaulted disjunctions raw (SC-3 root). The fix prunes the
  `.structuralCycle` arm WITHOUT collapsing the default into the value (collapse is
  unsound — `b: a & 2` needs the live non-default arm; cue's display-collapse is a
  projection). Folds in SC-3 dedup (`*1|*1|2` → `*1 | 2`). Eval-display divergence
  recorded (Kue shows `{…} | *null`, cue collapses — same convention as
  `default_disjunction`). 8 pins + 3 `export/` fixtures; cert-manager content-identical.
- 2026-06-20 — **D#2a** structural-cycle DETECTION (`Value.lean`
  `BottomReason.structuralCycle`; `Eval.lean` `structStack` /`isStructLikeBody` + `.refId`
  re-eval cycle bracket). The DESIGNED force-stack lever was wrong as built (the force
  triple never repeats — fresh frame ids); redesigned to a struct-body re-entrancy stack
  on the `.refId` path, keyed on the body `Value`. Detects def + regular + mutual struct
  cycles (class-agnostic), preserves `x: x` → `_`, no false-positive on finite-deep or
  list-tail recursion; cert-manager content-identical (zero false-fire). Value verdict
  CONFORMS to cue; eval-display differs (spec-gap recorded). 8 `native_decide` pins + 2
  `refs/` fixtures.
- 2026-06-19 — `d9f66ca` — **Bug2-3 / Gap-2b** structural list-arm-vs-struct-host
  disjunction pruning (gated `embedBodyEmbedsDisj` /`spliceOperandForEmbed`; cert-manager
  byte-identical; 4 soundness obligations verified; cue correct, Kue was under-pruning).
- 2026-06-19 — `3f7a761` — **Bug2-4** let-LOCAL declare-and-read narrowing
  (`letPromotedReadLabels` + `injectLetLocalNarrowings`, both total + axiom-clean; minimal
  Mixin repro content-identical to cue; surfaced the residual Bug2-5 argocd blocker).
- 2026-06-19 — `2ab5c84..3725444` — Phase-A audit of the Bug2-3 + Bug2-4 batch (both
  spec-correct + sound; CLI-vs-harness divergence reconciled BENIGN; filed DRY-1 — see
  backlog).
- 2026-06-19 — `5d884af..e4922c9` — Phase-A audit of the RX-2b + RX-1c batch (both
  spec-correct; recategorized the RX-2b field-less invalid-label entry to a spec gap;
  added 3 newline regression pins; RX-2c noted already DONE).
- 2026-06-19 — `a5862df..04eb7de` — Phase-A audit of the SC-2 + RX-1a + RX-1b batch (RE2
  engine RE2-correct beyond the 7 repros, 1 corpus divergence = RX-2a; SC-2 no over-close;
  filed RX-2a/RX-2b/RX-2c/SC-4 — see backlog).
- 2026-06-19 — `4358a7e` — Phase-B whole-graph sweep (post regex-trilogy; module graph
  healthy; Bug2-3 + D#2 designs RE-VERIFIED GO no drift; produced the #4 re-rank below).
- 2026-06-19 — `659cf70` — Phase-B whole-graph sweep (D#2-spike audit; Regex leaf
  exemplary; RX-2b soundness hole resolved across 5 sites; perf-guide currency fixed
  inline).
- 2026-06-19 — Batch 1 (areas A, B, C) complete — SC-1/SC-2/SC-3 + Gap-2b +
  vindicated-correct catalog + spec gaps (import laziness, `A|B` form, field order #3).
- 2026-06-19 — Batch 2 (areas D, E, F) complete — D#1–D#7, RX-1, BI-1/BI-2, F-1–F-5
  findings; numeric/bounds/division/decimal CONFORMS.
- 2026-06-19 — `df10043..ae63b8a` — Phase-A audit of the SC-1d + F-2 batch (both
  spec-correct, DRY, all consumers covered; SC-1d surfaced the nested-closedness bug
  folded into SC-2).
- 2026-06-19 — RX-1a/RX-1b/RX-1c — regex trilogy SHIPPED (`Kue/Regex.lean` RE2-equivalent
  parse → Thompson compile → Pike-VM; submatch + `ReplaceAll` /`Find*` via the capture
  array; 4 dispatch sites rewired; old `Value.lean` backtracking block deleted; totality
  argument replaces the prior fuel-as-truncation soundness hole). Remaining regex work:
  RX-2a (below).
- 2026-06-19 — SC-2 SHIPPED — nested def-body closedness closed at the FIRST meet via the
  `normalizeDefinitionFieldWithFuel` CLOSING twin (Normalize-only; SC-2a cue-agrees, SC-2b
  diverges and is recorded in `cue-divergences.md`; `importBinding` /`letBinding`/hidden
  trap arms untouched). Was the last open closedness HIGH.

## Consolidated fix backlog (re-audit COMPLETE — spec-first, ranked)

Feature work resumes here, spec-first. Ranked by severity; contained high-confidence fixes
front-loaded before the large rewrites. **This section owns the single authoritative
ranked backlog.** The ranking is Phase-B audit #4 (below); the detailed live-slice entries
follow it.

### Genuinely-open ranked backlog (current — 2026-06-23)

Ranking principle (slice-loop, reaffirmed): **spec-correctness and clean design
evolution** — contained-soundness before larger features; cue-AGREEING correctness before
divergence; designed levers before undesigned. Real-app compilation (argocd, cert-manager)
is a STRESS TEST, not a ranking driver.

**Everything spec-conformance-HIGH is DONE.** The large designed levers all landed —
Bug2-3/Gap-2b, D#2 (structural cycles, complete), the regex trilogy + RX-2a/b/c (corpus
divergence-free), BI-1 (Unicode case-fold), BI-2 (math.Pow + math.Sqrt, full real domain in
exact decimal — COMPLETE), F-1/F-2/F-3, E#4-fix (arithmetic domain), the D-area (D#1a-d, D#2,
D#3 — CLOSED), the dyn-field correctness family, the MEET-RESID-1 ripple family, the closedness
family (SC-1/1b/1c/1d/1e + SC-2, EMBED-CLOSE-1 pinned), the 4 spec-gap ratifications, AD2-1
(disjunction-normalizer unified), and EvalOps extraction (`plan.md` item 2, DONE 2026-06-22).
**The whole `Bug2-5 → Bug2-14c` argocd narrowing/close-once chain is RESOLVED (2026-06-22..23) —
argocd exports content-identical (jq -S diff = 0), the 2nd prod9 drop-in after cert-manager.**
SC-3 is a recorded spec-gap only (multi-arm-default display divergence). Detail for every one of
these is in Audit history + the Live-slice detail (below) + the implementation-log + git.

**The genuinely-open set (ranked):**

1. **perf #7 — frame-sharing across env-DEPENDENT evals (RANKED LEADER; proof-first, GATED).**
   argocd exports content-identical at **~50.3s** vs `cue` 0.03s; cert-manager ~11.7s. Perf #7's
   two safe wins landed 2026-06-23 (`selfEvaluatingLeaf?` fast path + saturated-only `satCache`
   insert, both jq-S=0, zero drift). The PROFILE named the residual: a **~175× re-eval factor**
   (`evalCalls=832338` core evals vs `distinctShapes=4763` distinct subtrees — the same subtree
   re-evaluated under ~175 distinct frame envs because the cache keys on `env.ids`; `evalCacheHits=0`,
   the fuel-keyed `cache` is dead). The designed fix — share env-DEPENDENT evals across frame envs
   (frame canonicalization or content-addressed def-body closures) — **touches the soundness core of
   frame identity (`FrameKey`/`ForceKey`) and needs a no-false-share proof.** A frame-sharing widening
   that could alias-corrupt a value is a Violation: profile + design + STOP beats an unsound ship.
   Detail in `plan.md` (NEXT LEADER block) + `kue-performance.md` + implementation-log (perf #7 slice).
2. **SC-4** (LOW, spec-gap-first — nested hidden/let-bound closedness on direct def-meet).
   Spec-check first; do not reflexively match cue (it is internally inconsistent here).
   See the SC-4 entry below.
3. **Bug2-12** (SELF-recursive case — **RESOLVED 2026-06-23**; MUTUAL tail OPEN; **multi-struct-conjunct
   OVER-CLOSE regression OPEN — see item 0 below**). A SELF-recursive closed def narrowed with an
   undeclared extra (`#X: #X & {a:1}` then `#X & {b:2}`, AND the inlined form) admitted the extra; cue
   rejects (spec-correct — closedness is a property of the definition, self-recursion does NOT re-open
   it). FIXED in `flattenConjDefRef`: a self-referential closed def's `.conj` body now closes its
   struct-literal conjuncts (the self-ref conjunct bottoms via the cycle path, contributing no fields, so
   the def's closedness must come from its own literals). Single-conjunct admit/pattern/open-tail/nested
   boundaries all conform; D#2 detection + canaries unchanged. The MUTUAL case (`#A: #B & {a}`, `#B: #A &
   {b}`) is a distinct leak deferred as a spec-gap (cue's "reject the def's own field" reading is
   lattice-questionable) — see `cue-spec-gaps.md` Bug2-12 MUTUAL row.

0. **Bug2-12b — MULTI-STRUCT-CONJUNCT self-rec OVER-CLOSE (TOP soundness regression, OPEN 2026-06-23).**
   The Bug2-12 fix `expanded.map (normalizeDefinitionValueWithFuel …)` closes EACH struct-literal conjunct
   of a self-recursive def SEPARATELY. For a self-rec def whose literals are SPLIT across `&`
   (`#X: #X & {a:1} & {c:3}`), this yields two independently-`defClosed` structs (`{a}` closed, `{c}`
   closed) whose meet rejects any field not in BOTH allowed-sets. Consequence: a use-site that re-declares
   the def's OWN field across the split (`out: #X & {c:3}`) BOTTOMS in kue, where **cue ADMITS
   `{a:1,c:3}`** — an over-close on a field the def itself declares. ISOLATED to multi-conjunct self-rec:
   the single-literal form (`#X: #X & {a:1, c:3}` → `& {c:3}` admits), non-self-rec multi-conjunct
   (`#X: {a:1, c:3}` → admits), and the genuine-extra reject (`& {b:2}` bottoms) all CONFORM. ROOT: the
   conjuncts must be closed over their COMBINED allowed-set (the Bug2-7 close-once principle), not
   individually — close-each is wrong exactly as Bug2-7 close-each was. NOT fixed inline: the correct fix
   merges the struct-literal conjuncts before closing, touching the soundness-critical conjunct-merge
   machinery (the same path whose first Bug2-12 attempt "broke 6 Bug2-6..9 pins"); it needs its own TDD
   slice (oracle: `#X: #X & {a:1} & {c:3}` ; `out: #X & {c:3}` → `{a:1,c:3}`, and `& {b:2}` → bottom).
   Witness battery in the audit; canaries unaffected (rare shape, both jq-S=0). RANKED ABOVE perf #7 —
   a contained-soundness over-close gates correctness before a perf lever.

   **FIX-SEAM DESIGN (Phase-B 2026-06-23 — design only, NO code; this is the next-leader slice).**
   - **WHERE.** `flattenConjDefRef` (`Eval.lean:1624`), the `close == true` branch at `:1655-1657`:
     ```
     let expanded := cs.flatMap (flattenConjDefRef env fuel)
     if close then expanded.map (normalizeDefinitionValueWithFuel normalizeFuel)
     else expanded
     ```
     `expanded.map close` is the close-EACH defect. For `#X: #X & {a:1} & {c:3}`, `expanded =
     [#X-refId, {a:1}, {c:3}]`; mapping the closer over it yields the self-ref `.refId` unchanged
     (closer leaves refs untouched) PLUS two structs each `mkStruct … .defClosed` with its OWN
     single self-clause (`{a}`, `{c}`). Their downstream `.conj`-meet CONCATENATES the two
     `closedClauses` → a field must be in BOTH allowed-sets → `c` rejected against `{a}`, `a` against
     `{c}` (and a use-site `& {c:3}` re-declares a field absent from the `{a}` clause → bottom).
   - **THE FIX — union the literals, close ONCE (the Bug2-6/2-7 close-once lever).** Partition
     `expanded` into (i) the union-able def-body literals (`isUnionableDefValue` — the `.struct`/
     `.structComp` field-bearing bodies, exactly the Bug2-6 union shape) and (ii) the rest (the
     self-ref `.refId` conjuncts — left UNTOUCHED so the cycle path still bottoms them — plus any
     deferred/scalar/disj conjunct). `foldl mergeDefinitionDecls` the literals into ONE body, then
     `normalizeDefinitionValueWithFuel normalizeFuel` that SINGLE merged body once. Re-emit
     `<untouched conjuncts> ++ [<single closed-union body>]`. `mergeDefinitionDecls` (`:385`) already
     unions fields (`mergeFieldListWith joinUnevaluated`, so a shared label still `.conj`-meets — the
     conflict edge is preserved), unions patterns, and unions openness via `unionDefOpenness` (OPEN
     dominates — so a `...` in any literal keeps the merged body open). `mkStruct` inside the closer
     then derives the SINGLE self-clause over `{a,c}` → admits `a`, `c`, and a re-declared `c`;
     rejects `b`. This is the exact Bug2-6 close-once result, now applied on the self-rec flatten path.
   - **CONFIRM the lever.** `mergeDefinitionDecls` IS the right primitive (it is reachable — defined at
     `:385`, well before `:1624`). Do NOT reach for `closedClauses` concatenation or `mergeConjOperands`
     here: the literals are repeated decls of ONE def path (the def's own body split across `&`), the
     WITHIN-operand union case — `mergeDefinitionDecls`, not the cross-operand `mergeConjFields` meet.
   - **HOW IT AVOIDS THE FIRST-ATTEMPT TRAP (broke 6 Bug2-6..9 pins).** The first Bug2-12 attempt was a
     BLANKET `.conj` close arm — it closed conjuncts that were NOT the def's own literals (nested/
     unreferenced/cross-operand bodies), re-closing them and breaking the multi-decl/embed pins. This
     fix is GATED identically to the current code (`close := field.fieldClass.isDefinition && isSelfRef`)
     — it fires ONLY for a genuinely self-referential closed def, and within that it touches ONLY the
     `isUnionableDefValue` literal conjuncts. The self-ref `.refId` is in the "rest" partition,
     UNCHANGED, so cycle DETECTION/termination (D#2a) and the `.refId` self-ref bottoming are untouched.
     A non-self-rec multi-conjunct def (`#LS: #Base & {#extra}`, `#Base` a DIFFERENT slot) is not
     `isSelfRef`, so `close == false` and the whole close-once-via-`closedClauses` fold (Bug2-6..9) is
     bypassed entirely — those pins never reach this arm. A nested/embedded def body inside a literal is
     normalized by the closer's own structural recursion (as today), not re-closed at the wrong level.
   - **MUST-PIN WITNESSES (the TDD slice's gate):**
     - FLIP (the OPEN target): `#X: #X & {a:1} & {c:3}` ; `out: #X & {c:3}` → ADMITS `{a:1,c:3}` (today
       bottoms — `bug212_multiconjunct_redeclare_OVERCLOSE` is the pin to flip to `exportJsonMatches`).
     - GENUINE-EXTRA still REJECTS: `#X: #X & {a:1} & {c:3}` ; `out: #X & {b:2}` → bottom (`b` in no
       literal).
     - SINGLE-LITERAL UNCHANGED: `#X: #X & {a:1, c:3}` ; `& {c:3}` admits (`bug212_singleliteral_redeclare_admits`).
     - OPEN-TAIL across split: `#X: #X & {a:1} & {c:3, ...}` ; `& {b:2}` → admits (openness UNIONs — new pin).
     - CONFLICT across split: `#X: #X & {a:1} & {a:2}` → bottom (shared label still `.conj`-meets — new pin).
     - The 6 Bug2-6..9 pins STAY GREEN: `bug26_*` (multi-decl close-once, distinct-closed-defs reject,
       closed-pattern admit/reject), `bug29_*` (named-multiconjunct narrow/tail/nested/conflict/closed).
     - D#2 guardrails green: `bug212_struct_cycle_still_bottoms`, `bug212_list_disj_still_terminates`.
     - Canaries jq-S = 0 (argocd ~50s, cert-manager ~11.5s — both unaffected, rare shape off-path).
4. **missing-field-selection — RESOLVED 2026-06-23.** A presence-test on a genuinely-MISSING
   (never-declared) field of a concrete struct (`x: {a:1}` then `x.b != _|_`) → kue `incomplete
   value` vs cue `false` (absent). Root cause: `selectFromDecls`'s miss arm DEFERRED to `.selector
   base label`, classified `.incomplete` by `classifyDefinedness`, so the comparison stayed
   unresolved. **The discriminator** (spec-verified vs cue v0.16.1): when selection reaches
   `selectFromDecls` the carrier is ALREADY an evaluated CONCRETE struct/embed carrier (or a
   resolved disjunction DEFAULT arm) — every conjunct merges into the struct value BEFORE selection
   (`x: base & extra` supplies `b` at unification, not at select), so a field absent from the merged
   decls is FINAL-absent and can never arrive later: it selects to `.bottom` (absent), matching cue
   even with an open `...` tail. The PROVISIONAL case — an UNRESOLVED disjunction with no unique
   default, where a later arm could supply the field — never reaches `selectFromDecls` (it stays the
   deferred `.selector base label` in `selectEvaluatedField`'s `.disj` `_ =>` arm). **Fix**: one
   line — `selectFromDecls`'s `none` arm yields `.bottom` (and the now-dead `base` param dropped).
   Same family as Bug2-13 (a deferral was masking final absence). The audit's noted deep form
   `x.a.missing` was ALREADY correct (the intermediate was a non-struct prim → catch-all bottom);
   the shallow `x.b` and deep-into-a-struct `x.a.c` were the broken cases, both now absent. Also
   fixed (free): a comprehension guard over a missing field now fires the correct arm, and a
   resolved-default-disjunction select reads absent. Canaries jq -S = 0 (not on the argocd path,
   zero drift). 10 `Bug2xTests` `mfs_*` pins + 5 `export/mfs_*` fixtures; one message-only
   divergence recorded (value-USE `y: x.b` — cue `undefined field`, kue generic bottom; both reject,
   presence-test now byte-matches).

Plus the **item-6 LOW tail** in `plan.md` (cosmetic/latent corners — `module-file-scoped-imports`,
parser strictness, `release-linux.sh` dirty-tree guard, A2-x/y, B2-A1/A2 — none soundness-bearing).

**Bug2-5 → Bug2-14c — the argocd narrowing/close-once chain — ALL RESOLVED (2026-06-22..23).**
A 10-fix chain that landed the argocd content-identical drop-in (jq -S diff = 0, ~50.3s). Each was
a distinct narrowing-delivery or close-once defect, surfaced by the previous fix and NOT the final
blocker until Bug2-14c. The full blow-by-blow (per-fix root cause, mechanism, repro, soundness
boundary, commit) is HISTORY — in `implementation-log.md` (one entry per fix) + git. Compressed:

- **Bug2-5** (`5fca57e`) — transitive-embed disj-path narrowing injection (`embedBodyEmbedsDisjDeep`).
- **Bug2-6** (`ef824cb`) — definition multi-declaration close-once (`mergeDefinitionDecls` UNIONs
  repeated decls of one def-path, closes ONCE; meet path untouched so `#A & #B` still rejects).
- **Bug2-7** (`3361699`) — close-once on the reference / force-fold path (per-operand
  `canonicalizeFields` in `mergeConjOperands`; within-operand UNION vs cross-operand MEET is the
  soundness boundary).
- **Bug2-8** (`2332aff`) — close-once ACROSS AN EMBED boundary, via a `DeclProvenance` sum
  (`ownDecl`/`embeddedDecl`) on a named `ConjOperand` — illegal-states-unrepresentable provenance
  carried in the type; only the differing-provenance same-def-path struct pair close-once-UNIONs.
- **Bug2-9** (`5d9cf8f`) — use-site narrowing of a REFERENCED NAMED multi-conjunct def
  (`flattenConjDefRef` flattens a depth-0 ref-to-`.conj`-bodied def into its constituents before the
  `.conj` fold = byte-identical to the inlined meet).
- **Bug2-10** (`aa4172b`) — narrowing into a `.structComp` HOST's embedded self-ref
  (`conjStructCompDefer?` routes it into the shared-`useOperands` fold) + a pre-existing embed-meet
  closedness leak fixed (`embeddingClosesHost`).
- **Bug2-11** (`bdced40`) — narrowing of a TWO-LEVEL cross-package def-of-def selector
  (`conjBodyHasDeferringArm` + `.conj`-body capture in `importDefClosureBody?` + a `.conj` force-fold
  arm, each arm keeping its OWN package frame — the wrong-frame hazard pinned by
  `crosspkg_defofdef_wrongframe_witness`).
- **Bug2-13** (`7e69e43`) — unset optional selection reads as ABSENT (the polarity bug lived in
  field SELECTION, not the `classifyDefinedness` classifier: `selectedFieldValue` + the `.refId` eval
  arm resolve an `.optional`-rung field to `.bottom`; the over-fire guard is the `.optional` rung
  itself — a SET optional downgrades to `.regular`). The selection-time analog of
  `containsBottomFields`'s optional-skip.
- **Bug2-14 (case-D PLAIN-EMBED)** (`e404b21`) — an embed declaring a label ABSTRACTLY which the host
  narrows CONCRETELY left the embed body's sibling/comprehension read bound to the embed-LOCAL value;
  fixed by `injectEmbedSiblingNarrowings` (the embed-body analog of `injectLetLocalNarrowings`). NOT
  the terminal blocker.
- **Bug2-14b + Bug2-14c** (2026-06-23) — the LAST two on-path layers. The argocd `#Mixin` is a
  STRUCTURAL DISJUNCTION (`listShape | structShape | error`) embedding a `let _patch` whose
  `for…if kind==…` guard reads a host-narrowed sibling `kind`. **Bug2-14b** — `embedBodyEmbedsDisjDeep`
  was gated against the OUTER fold `env`; the body's own embed-refs are relative to the def frame the
  force PUSHES (the Bug2-11 wrong-frame hazard), fixed by a `bodyForceFrameEnv` helper at all three
  gate sites. **Bug2-14c** — the real `defaults.#ListenerSet = defs.#ListenerSet &
  parts.#UseCertManager & {…}` is a MULTI-CLOSURE conjunction where `kind` lives in one closure and
  the disjunction+`_patch` in another; the `.conj` fold forced each closure independently so `kind`
  never reached `_patch.kind`. Fixed by a TWO-PASS fold splicing a sibling closure's regular fields
  into a disjunction-bearing closure. Sound: arm selection stays correct (struct arm wins,
  list/error prune), incomplete-guard DEFERS (not force-drain), real conflict BOTTOMS, cert-manager
  content-identical. Module fixtures `bug214{b,c}_*`; inline `Bug2xTests` pins. One spec-silent corner
  recorded (`cue-spec-gaps.md`: abstract-`kind` disjunction-arm — kue defers `incomplete`, cue picks
  the `error` arm, both correctly NON-drain). **HONEST: the whole 37230-byte manifest byte-matches
  cue under sorted keys — no on-path layer hides behind a sound drain.**

**Bug2-12** (SELF-recursive — **RESOLVED 2026-06-23**; MUTUAL tail recorded OPEN): a SELF-recursive
closed def narrowed with an undeclared extra (`#X: #X & {a:1}` then `#X & {b:2}`, AND the inlined
`(#X & {a:1}) & {b:2}`) admitted `b` (`{a:1,b:2}`); cue rejects (`field not allowed`).
**Spec-verified cue is CORRECT here** — closedness is a property of the definition, independent of
how its body self-references; self-recursion does NOT open the def. Root cause: the def body `#X & {a:1}`
parses to a `.conj [#X, {a:1}]`, and the structural-cycle path terminated the self-`#X` to a shallow
bottom while leaving the surviving `{a:1}` OPEN — the def-closedness was never applied to the cycle-folded
struct (the closer `normalizeDefinitionValueWithFuel` has no `.conj` arm, and `refDefClosureBody?` skips a
non-struct-like `.conj` body, so the bare-ref/flatten path produced an open struct). **FIX** (`flattenConjDefRef`,
`Eval.lean`): when expanding a DEFINITION field whose `.conj` body is genuinely SELF-REFERENTIAL (a depth-0
conjunct refs the same slot), close each expanded conjunct via `normalizeDefinitionValueWithFuel` — the
struct literals close (`{a:1}` → `defClosed`), while the self-ref `.refId` conjunct is left untouched by the
closer so the cycle path bottoms it identically. cert-manager + argocd jq -S = 0 (zero recursive defs, no
firing); a non-self-recursive multi-conjunct def (`#LS: #Base & {#extra}`, Bug2-6..9) is NOT self-referential
so its narrowing conjuncts stay OPEN and the close-once-via-`closedClauses` fold is untouched. The MUTUAL
case (`#A: #B & {a}`, `#B: #A & {b}`) is a SEPARATE leak — kue under-closes (admits), cue rejects even the
def's OWN field; cue's mutual reading is lattice-questionable, so it is recorded as an OPEN spec-gap rather
than blindly matched (`cue-spec-gaps.md` Bug2-12 MUTUAL row), deferred as a future fix-slice. (The
Bug2-5..2-14c chain that surfaced it is RESOLVED — see the compressed summary above.)

Audit cadence + the non-spec-conformance plan roadmap live in `plan.md` / the breadcrumb,
not here.

**HIGH — soundness / real-app correctness (the LARGE designed levers):**

- **Bug2-3 / Gap-2b — DONE (2026-06-19, `d9f66ca`).** See Audit history.
- **D#2 — COMPLETE (2026-06-20).** Detection (D#2a) + terminating-disjunct (D#2b) both
  landed. `#L:{n,next:#L}` errors (cyclic re-entry bottoms with `.structuralCycle`);
  `#List | *null` terminates on `*null` (`tail: null`, byte-identical to cue). Detection =
  struct-body re-entrancy stack (`structStack`) on the `.refId` re-eval path (NOT the
  designed force-stack — see the archived D#2 design section below). Termination =
  `normalizeEvaluatedDisj` now applies `liveAlternatives` (prune-bottom/dedup) on the
  has-default branch, pruning the `.structuralCycle` arm WITHOUT collapsing the default
  into the value (unsound — see implementation-log). A#6 fuel cap was NOT implicated
  (detection at depth ~2 ⇒ shallow bottom). SC-3 dedup folded in. cert-manager
  content-identical (zero false-fire; prod9 has ZERO recursive defs). See Audit history +
  implementation-log 2026-06-20.

**BI-2-residual (MED — SPLIT; sqrt + Pow-½ DONE 2026-06-21, exp/ln increment filed).** The
prior framing ("needs a Float/NaN/Infinity model; no sub-domain carve-out-able") was WRONG
and is corrected here: **Float was never needed and is correctly avoided.** Kue is
exact-rational by design, so the sound move is to compute in EXACT DECIMAL and record the
divergence from cue's fallible float artifacts — not to import IEEE.

**SHIPPED (2026-06-21).** **(a) `math.Sqrt` + `Pow(·, ½)`** via `Decimal.sqrt`
(`decimalSqrt`): a FIXED-iteration integer-Newton square root (`isqrtNewton`/`isqrtNat` —
`x' = (x + N/x)/2` on `Nat`, budget `2·digits + 8`, min-tracked so it lands EXACTLY on
`⌊√N⌋`; structurally recursive on the budget, hence total — `#print axioms` shows no
`sorryAx`/`partial`). For `a = num/10^s`, `√a = ⌊√(num·10^(2P−s))⌋/10^P` with `P ≥ 40`;
perfect squares collapse to int (`Sqrt(144)=12`, `Sqrt(100)=10` — NOT cue's `1e+1`), exact
non-integer roots trim (`Sqrt(2.25)=1.5`), irrationals render to 34 sig digits via the
shared division renderer (`Sqrt(2)=1.414…209698`, BYTE-IDENTICAL to cue's OWN apd
`Pow(2,½)`). `math.Sqrt` and `math.Pow(·,½)` route through the SAME function, so
`Sqrt(x)=Pow(x,½)` (cue's float64 `Sqrt` ≠ apd `Pow` — cue is internally inconsistent; Kue
is more precise + self-consistent — recorded as a kue-more-correct divergence). Domain
errors BOTTOM: `Sqrt(neg)`, `Pow(neg,½)` (real-domain / complex), NEVER `NaN`. Files:
`Kue/Decimal.lean` (`isqrtNewton`/`isqrtNat`/`decimalSqrt`), `Kue/Builtin.lean`
(`decimalSqrtSigned`/`mathSqrt?`/`isHalfExponent`, `mathPow?` ½-route, `math.Sqrt` arm),
17 `BuiltinTests` pins, `builtins/math_sqrt` fixture (14 cases).

**SHIPPED — BI-2-§3 (2026-06-21, `cd2f0a9`).** The residual-of-the-residual is DONE; the
**BI-2 family is now COMPLETE** — `math.Pow`/`math.Sqrt` cover their full real domain in
EXACT DECIMAL, no Float, axiom-clean. **§1 negative-INTEGER exponent**: `x^(-n) = 1/x^n` via
`reciprocalDecimalToValue` over the existing exact int-pow + the division renderer — an
EXACT rational (`Pow(2,-3)=0.125`, `Pow(10,-2)=0.01`, `Pow(1,-5)=1` collapses,
`Pow(3,-1)=0.333…333` at 34 sig digits). **§2 general non-½ fractional exponent** (`x > 0`):
`x^y = exp(y·ln x)` via `decimalExpScaled`/`decimalLnScaled` in `Decimal.lean`.
`decimalLnScaled`: range-reduce `x = m·2^k`, `m ∈ [⅔,4/3)`, `ln x = k·ln2 + ln m`, `ln m =
2·artanh((m−1)/(m+1))` as a FIXED 40-odd-term series (`|t| ≤ ⅕` on the reduced range ⇒ tail
`< 10⁻⁵⁵`). `decimalExpScaled`: range-reduce `z = n·ln2 + r`, `|r| ≤ ln2/2`, `exp z =
2ⁿ·exp r`, `exp r = Σ rᵏ/k!` as a FIXED 60-term series (running factorial threaded). Working
scale 50 (16 guard digits past the 34-sig render context); every intermediate is a scaled
`Int` (`mulScaled`/`divScaled` truncate back), so all arithmetic is exact. Both series + both
binary range-reduction loops run a FIXED budget ⇒ structurally total, no `partial`/`sorry`
(`decimalExpScaled`/`decimalLnScaled` depend on ZERO axioms; the `Pow` path only on
`propext`/`Quot.sound`/`Classical.choice`). Results round to 34 sig digits and collapse to
`int` when integral (`Pow(4,1.5)=8`, `Pow(8,⅓)=2`); the MANTISSA is byte-identical to cue's
apd `Pow` across the corpus (40 random + extreme-magnitude cases verified, plus
`Pow(2,0.5)=Sqrt(2)` cross-check — the ½ case still routes through `decimalSqrt` for
exactness). **Domain edges → bottom**: `Pow(neg, non-integer)` (complex — cue errors),
`Pow(0,0)`, `Pow(0,neg)` (cue → `Infinity`); `Pow(0,positive)=0`. Divergences (display only,
value-identical, same family as Sqrt): cue pads terminating expansions to fixed width / uses
scientific notation; Kue trims + renders plain — recorded in `cue-divergences.md`. Files:
`Kue/Decimal.lean` (`lnExpScale`/`lnExpUnit`/`ln2Scaled`/`mulScaled`/`divScaled`/`lnArtanhSeries`
/`lnMantissa`/`lnRangeReduce{Up,Down}`/`decimalLnScaled`/`expTaylorSeries`/`applyPow2Scaled`
/`decimalExpScaled`/`intSigDigits`/`roundScaledToSigDigits`/`decimalPowGeneral`),
`Kue/Builtin.lean` (`reciprocalDecimalToValue`, rewired `mathPow?`), 13 `BuiltinTests` pins,
11 new `builtins/math_pow` fixture cases.

**SC-1b — DONE (2026-06-21).** Closed×closed-pattern intersection. The old
`closingPatterns : List Value` was a FLAT UNION across conjuncts — it could only express
"matches ANY stored predicate," so a meet of two closed structs admitted a field matching
EITHER conjunct's pattern. The correct closed allowed-set is the INTERSECTION: a field
survives iff EVERY closed conjunct admits it. A flat list of label-predicates cannot
represent this (you cannot intersect "matches `^x` " and "matches `^y` " into one regex).
**Fix: provenance-carrying representation** — replaced `closingPatterns` with
`closedClauses : List ClosedClause`, where each clause `{fieldLabels, patterns}` is ONE
closed conjunct's allowed-set; a field is admitted iff EVERY clause admits it
(`ignoresClosedness` escapes; empty clause list = open). A self-closed struct carries one
clause; a meet CONCATENATES clauses (conjunction). This is exactly the provenance the
closedness guide mandates ("which conjuncts introduced which patterns and closedness
constraints"). The original audit witness (same-pattern `^x`, disjoint *explicit* fields)
was MASKED — the disjoint required fields materialize and poison, so the union-store's
lossiness wasn't observable there. The REAL witnesses use DIFFERENT patterns:
`#A:{[=~"^x"]} & #B:{[=~"^y"]}` then `& {x1}` — `x1` matches `^x` not `^y`, must be
rejected (cue rejects; pre-fix Kue admitted). Field-side too (CRUX): a field-only closed
clause `#A:{a?}` must reject a later `x1` that matches `#B` 's `^x` (the merged `fields`
over-approximates each clause's field-set, so per-clause field-labels are needed). 17
pins: 12 source-level (`exportJson{Bottoms,Matches}` in `StructTests` `### SC-1b` —
disjoint/overlapping/narrower patterns, field-only-clause, broad-then-narrow, 3-way assoc,
nested, direct-meet, `close()` -idempotence, closed-empty) + 5 clause-logic units
(`fieldAllowedByClausesWith` = `all` /conjunction, in `LatticeTests`) + a fixture pair
(`definitions/sc1b_closed_pattern_intersection`). cert-manager export still semantically =
cue (def-meet hot path clean). All oracle-confirmed vs cue v0.16.1.

**SC-1e — DONE (2026-06-21).** Closed × OPEN-via-`...`: a CLOSED struct met with an
open-tail struct must STAY closed — the `...` does NOT re-open the closed conjunct
(closedness is monotone under meet). cue (CORRECT): `#A:{[=~"^x"]} & {b:1, ...}` rejects
`b`; `#C:{a} & {b, ...}` rejects `b`. Kue admitted all (PRE-EXISTING, confirmed on the
`f0613e5` baseline).

**Diagnosis was WIDER than the phase-B sketch.** The breadcrumb named only the
tail×patterns CATCH-ALL arm (`Lattice.lean:1009`), because the pattern-closed witness
routed there. Instrumenting found a FIELD-closed def (`#C:{a:int}`, no patterns) routes
through the `struct × structTail` arm (`none, [], some tail, []`) and ALSO dropped the
clause. **All four tail-bearing arms** hardcoded
`mkStruct … .defOpenViaTail (some tail) []`: arms 2, 3, and the catch-all are vulnerable
(a closed operand has no tail, so it sits on the plain side); arm 4 (tail×tail) is safe
(both operands open ⇒ `bothClauses = []`).

**Fix:** a single local `closeTailResult` in `mergeStructN` that all four tail arms route
through, branching on `closedOpenness.isOpen` (= `StructOpenness.meet`, which already
makes `defClosed` dominate `defOpenViaTail`). Open ⇒ keep the tail, `[]` clauses. Closed ⇒
collapse to a no-tail `defClosed` result carrying `bothClauses`, `applyBothClosedness`
over the merged fields (forbidden extras → `_|_`, exactly as the no-`...` control). The
`[] ↔ open` invariant holds. cert-manager byte-identical to the pre-fix baseline (pure
no-op there). 9 `native_decide` pins (`StructTests ### SC-1e` + `### EMBED-CLOSE-1`) + 4
fixture pairs, all oracle-confirmed.

**RX-2a — DONE (2026-06-20).** In-class `\D` /`\W`/`\S` set-complement folding. See Audit
history + implementation-log. The regex corpus is now divergence-free (RX-1 trilogy +
RX-2a/b/c all DONE).

**SC-4 (LOW, spec-gap-first).** Hidden-field / let-bound-PLAIN-struct nested values do not
close on DIRECT def unification (`#A:{_h:{b:int}}; #A & {_h:{b,extra}}` and the let
analog) where cue closes. cue is INTERNALLY INCONSISTENT (direct-`&` closes,
select-then-`&` does not), so this is probably a cue eval-strategy artifact, not a spec
mandate. **Spec-check FIRST** (record in `cue-spec-gaps.md`); only then decide whether to
route these through the closing twin. Do NOT reflexively match cue. Lowest priority.
(Origin: SC-1-batch + SC-2 Phase-A under-close hunt; the SC-2 design deliberately routes
`letBinding` /hidden through the SPINE, correct for a let/hidden bound to a DEF — `c8b`
/`c4b` paths where Kue==cue==OPEN.)

**MED tail:**

9. **D#1b — DONE (2026-06-20).** Incomplete-guard deferral. A genuinely-abstract guard (a
   `.kind`, bound, unresolved disjunction, or non-presence comparison) now DEFERS — the
   comprehension stays a residual `.structComp` /`.comprehension`/`.listComprehension`
   node (cue eval-holds; `kue export` errors `incomplete value`), instead of dropping to
   `{}` /`[]`. Result protocol gained `ClauseExpansion` /`ListClauseExpansion`
   (`fields`/`bottom`/`deferred`); `withDeferredComprehensions` re-wraps. The residual
   PRESENCE test `X !=/== _|_` is CARVED OUT (stays a drop — cue eval drops it). Spec-gap
   recorded (defer mechanism); display divergence recorded (Kue renders the held ref as
   `@d.i`). See Audit history + implementation-log 2026-06-20.
10. **D#1c — DONE (2026-06-20).** Concrete non-bool guard → TYPE ERROR. A fully-concrete
    present value of non-`bool` type (`if "x"`/`if 3`/`if {…}`/`if [..]`/`if null`) is now
    a `.bottomWith [.nonBoolGuard ty]` that propagates (cue: `cannot use … as type bool`),
    NOT a `{}` drop. New `BottomReason.nonBoolGuard` + precise `NonBoolGuardType` (`scalar
    Kind`/`struct`/`list`). CONFORMS (cue+Kue agree, both modes). Split from D#1b in the
    SAME `classifyGuard` enumeration (no catch-all). See Audit history +
    implementation-log 2026-06-20.
11. **D#3 — DONE (2026-06-20).** `let` clauses in comprehensions. `Clause.letClause`
    added; `descendClauses` `.letClause` arm wires `let` = +1 (via `onSource` + frame
    push), so all 5 frame-walkers + `clauseChainDepth` handle it. Parse (`parseLetClause`,
    clause-chain-only so a field-head `let` stays a struct-body binding — spec
    `StartClause` excludes `let`); eval binds the evaluated value into a `for`
    -element-style frame (alignment-correct). The for=+1/if=+0 model is spec-CORRECT
    (B7-vindicated); `let` joined as +1. 9 pins + 6 fixtures; cert-manager
    content-identical. The D-area is now CLOSED. See Audit history + implementation-log
    2026-06-20.
12. **SC-3 — flatten/dedup half DONE (2026-06-20, folded into D#2b); display-collapse
    residual is LOW/spec-gap.** `normalizeEvaluatedDisj` now applies `liveAlternatives`
    (flatten/drop-bottom/dedup) on the non-all-regular branch — `*1|*1|2` eval → `*1 | 2`
    (deduped), `.structuralCycle` arms pruned. The prescribed fix is landed. What REMAINS
    is purely cue's further DISPLAY-collapse to the default (`*1|2` → `1`, `{…} | *null` →
    `null`), which Kue deliberately does NOT do — collapsing into the value is unsound
    (loses the live non-default arm a later meet needs; cf. `default_disjunction.expected`
    Kue `*"prod"|"dev"` vs cue `"prod"`). That cosmetic display projection (a Format-layer
    change rewriting ~7 fixtures) is recorded as a spec-gap (`cue-spec-gaps.md` D#2b/SC-3
    row), not a value bug — close it only if the eval-display convention is ever
    revisited.
13. **F-3 — DONE (2026-06-20).** Qualified import path `"location:identifier"` now parses.
    The spec grammar `ImportPath = '"' ImportLocation [ ":" identifier ] '"'` puts the
    qualifier INSIDE the string; `splitImportPath` splits it out at parse time into a new
    `Import.packageName : Option String` (location-only `path` + explicit qualifier), so
    every path consumer (`isBuiltinImport`/`resolveImportTarget`/`lastPathElement`) sees
    the bare location — the previous bug fed the unstripped `:id` into directory
    resolution (`package directory not found: …/math-utils:math`). `isPackageIdentifier`
    validates the qualifier (identifier-start + parts, not `#` /`_#`) at PARSE, rejecting
    junk cue defers to a load error (F-3 divergence). `importBindName` precedence is alias
    > qualifier > declared-name > last-element. SCOPE = parse + bind-name; the stricter
    suffix-vs-loaded-declared-name MISMATCH gate (cue's `package name "other"`) is a
    recorded resolution residual (needs the loaded name). 8 parse pins + 4
    `importBindName` /`isPackageIdentifier` pins + 4 module fixtures
    (`qualified_import{,_bare,_mixed,_invalid_id}`, all byte-identical to cue on the
    success cases). 1 cue-divergence (junk-qualifier parse-reject) + 1 spec-gap (validity
    boundary + parse-only scope). See implementation-log 2026-06-20.
14. **BI-2 — DONE (2026-06-20), with residual.** `math.Pow` (EXACT
    non-negative-integer-exponent domain — repeated exact decimal multiply, byte-identical
    to cue; `Pow(0,0)` bottoms, CONFORMS)
    + `list.Sort` /`list.SortStable` (comparator `{x,y,less}` evaluated per pair at the
      EVAL layer via
    a total stable monadic merge sort; `list.Ascending` /`Descending` emitted by
    `stdlibPackageValue?`) all FIXED. **BI-2-residual — `math.Sqrt` + `Pow(·,½)` DONE
    2026-06-21:** EXACT DECIMAL (`decimalSqrt` — fixed-iteration integer-Newton, total; Float
    correctly AVOIDED). Perfect squares collapse to int, irrationals → 34 sig digits;
    `Sqrt(x) = Pow(x,½)` (kue-more-correct divergence); `Sqrt(neg)`/`Pow(neg,½)` BOTTOM (no
    `NaN`). **BI-2-§3 — DONE 2026-06-21 (`cd2f0a9`), BI-2 family now COMPLETE:** §1 negative-INT
    exponent `x^(-n)=1/x^n` (exact rational); §2 general non-½ fractional `x^y = exp(y·ln x)`
    via `decimalExpScaled`/`decimalLnScaled` (fixed 40/60-term Taylor + binary range reduction,
    working scale 50, structurally total, axiom-clean). Mantissa byte-identical to cue's apd
    across 40 random + extreme cases; integral results collapse (`Pow(4,1.5)=8`, `Pow(8,⅓)=2`);
    `Pow(neg,non-int)`/`Pow(0,0)`/`Pow(0,neg)` BOTTOM (no `NaN`/`Infinity`). `math.Pow`/`Sqrt`
    now cover the full real domain — nothing open. See the BI-2-§3 SHIPPED block above +
    implementation-log 2026-06-21; spec gaps in `cue-spec-gaps.md` (BI-2 Pow/Sqrt + Sort rows);
    divergences in `cue-divergences.md` (Sqrt-vs-float64, NaN/Inf→bottom, general-Pow rendering).
15. **BI-1 (MED) — DONE 2026-06-20 (CONFORMS across the BMP).** Unicode case mapping for
    `strings.ToUpper/ToLower` shipped via an oracle-generated BMP simple-mapping table
    (`Kue/CaseTable.lean`, generated by `scripts/gen-case-table.py` from the local oracle,
    READ-ONLY no network; total binary-search lookup + Unicode char maps in `Builtin.lean`;
    ASCII maps deleted — the table is the single authority). `ToUpper("café")=="CAFÉ"`,
    `ToLower("ΑΒΓ")=="αβγ"`, byte-identical to cue across the BMP incl. irregular
    singletons (`µ`→`Μ`, `ÿ` →`Ÿ`) and the `ß` -no-expand simple-mapping boundary. New
    `StringsTests` module (case pins moved out of BuiltinTests + Unicode
    round-trips/singletons/boundaries/mixed + lookup unit pins) + `strings_case_unicode`
    fixture. **Residual (documented, deferred — NOT this slice):** (i) `ToTitle` stays
    ASCII-bounded — its Unicode TITLE-case mapping (`ǆ`→`ǅ`, ≠ upper) + `unicode.IsSpace`
    word boundary need their own table+predicate (the ONE remaining case-builtin
    divergence: `ToTitle("über alles")` Kue `"über Alles"` vs cue `"Über Alles"`); (ii)
    full case folding (`ß`→`SS`), locale (Turkish `ı` /`İ`), Greek final sigma,
    astral-plane letters — all recorded in `cue-spec-gaps.md` + `compat-assumptions.md`.
    See implementation-log 2026-06-20. Spike findings (for the record): (a) UNAVAILABLE —
    `lake-manifest` has ZERO external deps (no Std/Batteries/Mathlib); Lean core
    `Char.toUpper/toLower` are ASCII-only, no Unicode tables in core. (b) algorithmic
    ranges REJECTED as a clean slice — local oracle (`cue export` over the whole BMP)
    shows the mapping is overwhelmingly IRREGULAR: 1190 ToUpper / 1173 ToLower BMP code
    points collapse to only 674/658 offset-runs, of which **632/617 are SINGLETONS**; just
    ~13 contiguous regular runs (ASCII, Latin-1 supplement, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian,
    fullwidth…). A (b) covering only the regular runs would leave all of Latin
    Extended-A/B (the even/odd ±1 letter pairs + hundreds of one-offs like µ→Μ +743, ÿ→Ÿ
    +121) WRONG — a weak partial on very common European text; covering the full set
    algorithmically = hand-transcribing ~650 rules as code (strictly worse than a table).
    (c) CHOSEN: generate a BMP **simple 1:1** case-mapping table from the local `cue`
    oracle (READ-ONLY, no network), embed as a Lean source file, commit the generator +
    table + provenance. cue's `strings.ToUpper/ToLower` are confirmed pure rune-wise
    SIMPLE mapping (length-in-code-points preserved across the BMP; NO ß→SS expansion —
    `ToUpper("ß")=="ß"`), so a 1:1 table is faithful; full-case-folding special-casing
    (ß→SS, locale ı/İ, final sigma) stays a documented spec-gap.

**Spec-gap decisions (the 4 ratifications) — DONE 2026-06-20.** All four were re-derived
from the spec + first principles and closed; see `cue-spec-gaps.md` for the full bases.
Verdicts:
- **Import-binding laziness** (B#2/F-5) — **RATIFIED.** Spec genuinely silent; keep
  tolerating on an operational-laziness basis (demand-driven value model; the
  `importBinding` marker keeps the package shallow). Includes the recategorized RX-2b
  field-less-invalid-label entry. Pinned by the `unreferenced_import_conflict` fixture +
  `rx2b_label_pattern_invalid_bottoms`.
- **`A|B` un-narrowed struct disjunction** (A) — **RATIFIED.** Spec silent; keep open — a
  join with no unique default IS the join (verified meet-identity vs `.top`). Corrected
  the prior "`incomplete`" mischaracterization (it is the open disjunction value, not an
  error). New pins `StructTests` `disj_struct_arms_no_default_*`.
- **Field order #3** (C/F-4) — **RATIFIED.** Spec silent (structs unordered, order
  implementation-defined); keep Kue's declaration/source order. Corrected the cue-behavior
  description (cue's cross-conjunct order is an undocumented internal-graph artifact, not
  the "first-introduced" rule once claimed — often sorts, sometimes interleaves).
  Supersedes plan item #4: parity DECLINED. New pin
  `meet_struct_field_order_is_declaration_order`.
- **list `+` /`*`** (E#4) — ✅ **DONE (E#4-fix, 2026-06-20).** Was MIS-FILED as a gap; the
  spec MANDATES the operator domain, so a concrete out-of-domain operand is a type error.
  cue is spec-correct; Kue was WRONG (held residual). FIXED — Kue now conforms. See the
  DONE entry below
  + `cue-spec-gaps.md` (RESOLVED row, NOT a `cue-divergence` — cue was right).

**E#4-fix — ✅ DONE (2026-06-20).** A concrete operand outside an arithmetic op's domain is
now a type-error bottom, not a held residual (the spec closes `+ - * /` over int/decimal,
plus `+` /`*` over string/bytes). `classifyArithOperand` (`Eval.lean`) classifies each
operand `prim` / `concreteNonArith` (`.struct`/`.list`/`.listTail`/`.embeddedList`) /
`incomplete`; `arithmeticDomainResult` type-errors (`.bottomWith [.nonArithmeticOperand op
ty]`) ONLY a concrete-nonarith operand paired with a CONCRETE partner, and DEFERS
(`.binary` residual) whenever either operand is incomplete — so `[1] + x` holds while
`x: int` is abstract and errors only after `x` resolves (matches cue; the
concrete-vs-incomplete discipline mirrors D#1b/c `classifyGuard`). The `prim,prim`
mismatches (`1+"x"`, `"a"-"b"`) were already `.bottom` and unchanged. Sibling fix:
`evalMul` gained the string/bytes `*` int **repetition** arms (`"ab"*2="abab"`, either
order, zero→ empty, negative→`negativeRepeatCount` error) — cue's documented behavior
superseding strings/bytes.Repeat, previously a silent wrong-bottom. Pins: 3 `numeric/*`
fixtures + ~19 `native_decide` theorems (`EvalTests`). Verify: `lake build` green,
`check-fixtures.sh` → `fixture pairs ok` (zero drift), cert-manager content-identical to
cue (modulo field-order #3).

**Low / hardening:** `containsBottom` fuel cap 100 (**A#6 — ✅ DONE 2026-06-21, made
TOTAL/structural**; `Lattice.lean:160`). Was: a bottom >100 levels deep escaped pruning →
wrong value (a dead disjunction arm survived `liveAlternatives`); a partiality hole.
**STANDALONE — D#2b confirmed it was NOT implicated by structural cycles** (D#2a detection
fires at recursion depth ~2, so a `.structuralCycle` bottom is always shallow); the hole
was for genuinely-deep NON-cyclic nested bottoms. **Fix:** removed the fuel entirely —
rewrote `containsBottom` as a mutual block (`containsBottom` + 4 list-helpers) elaborated
via `termination_by structural`, so it is TOTAL (no depth bound: a `.bottom` at ANY depth
is found) AND `rfl` /`decide`-reducible (structural recursion reduces in the kernel; a
`sizeOf` WF measure would have broken the existing `meet` /manifest `rfl` proofs).
`fieldBottomCounts` folded inline into `containsBottomFields` (optional-skip rule
preserved). Axiom-clean (`propext` only). Cert-manager byte-identical to pre-fix HEAD;
fixtures zero-drift; 8 adversarial `native_decide` pins (deep-150/-500 bottom detected,
deep no-bottom false, deep `.bottomWith`, deep optional-skip, `liveAlternatives`
/`normalizeDisj` end-to-end) in `LatticeTests.lean`. Also: `{#a:1,5}`
scalar-embed-with-definitions coverage gap; D#1b incomplete-guard deferral (couples with
D#2).

**DRY-1 (LOW Phase-B refactor, no behavior change).** Extract a shared `walkFollowedLets`
(visited-set + fuel + `.structComp` /`.struct` destructure) combinator and refactor
`closeDefFrameReadIndices` (collects `List Nat` indices), `letPromotedReadLabels`
(collects `List String` labels), `injectLetLocalNarrowings` (rewrites → `Value`) onto it —
the `seen.contains` /fuel-decrement/`.structComp`-vs-`.struct` destructure is copied ~3×.
The COMPOSERS (`embedComprehensionReadLabels`, `embedDisjArmDeclLabels`,
`embedBodyEmbedsDisj`, `spliceOperandForEmbed`) are NOT duplicative — each encodes a
distinct CUE rule. Pure cleanup; gate on byte-identical fixtures + axiom-clean. **Schedule
after Bug2-5** (which adds a 4th walker on the disj path — fold it into the same
combinator in one pass rather than refactoring twice).

**Plan-hygiene / docs-reconciliation (recurring, non-code).** `plan.md` and this audit doc
re-accrete superseded re-ranks, completed Phase-A/B write-ups, and resolved fix-slice
diagnoses; a hygiene pass periodically distills the backlog to the LIVE open set + North
Star
+ standing capabilities and moves DONE detail to `implementation-log.md` /git. Last run
2026-06-21 (distilled the ~9 accreted audit blocks + the shipped D#2 design out of both
docs; RX-2c marked DONE — `maxRepeat=1000` landed with RX-1a). `docs/README.md` +
`www/index.html` routing/refresh is owned by the orchestrator — not touched here.

**Spec-doc errors (cosmetic, no code action):** the CUE spec's disjunction worked-example
comments contradict its own U2 rule (cue + Kue both follow the rule); the
`2 & >=1.0 & <3.0` example is stale. No action.

## D#2 design (structural-cycle detection) — SHIPPED, archived

The full D#2 design spike (oracle ground truth, the superseded `ForceKey` -triple
ancestor-scheme, the as-built `structStack` redesign, the terminating-disjunct algebra,
the soundness/totality argument, and the 2-slice plan) is HISTORY: D#2a + D#2b both landed
2026-06-20 and D#2 (structural cycles) is COMPLETE. The as-built detail lives in
[`../reference/implementation-log.md`](../reference/implementation-log.md) (D#2a/D#2b
entries) and git; the spec-gap on the eval-display of the cycle bottom is in
[`../reference/cue-spec-gaps.md`](../reference/cue-spec-gaps.md) (D#2a row). The design
prose is no longer carried here — the slice shipped and the behavior is pinned.
