# Spec-conformance re-audit

A full re-examination of every `cue`-grounded behavioral decision in Kue against the **CUE
language spec** and **lattice first principles**, triggered by the 2026-06-19 reframe
(`docs/guides/slice-loop.md` → "The CUE spec is the authority"). The slice loop had drifted
into byte-identical-to-`cue`-v0.16.1 as the correctness gate — structurally bug-replicating.
This audit reclassifies what is actually correct vs. what merely matches a fallible binary.

Feature slices are PAUSED until the high-risk areas are reclassified; findings here become
the spec-first fix-slice backlog in `plan.md`.

## Authority hierarchy (the gate)

1. **CUE language spec** — authoritative where it speaks; match it even against the binary.
2. **Lattice / first principles** — where the spec is silent (often): derive the
   mathematically-correct behavior (precise, total, illegal-states-unrepresentable).
3. **`cue` binary** — fallible cross-check ONLY. Never the gate.

## Classification taxonomy (every behavior gets one verdict)

- **CONFORMS** — spec speaks, Kue matches it (and `cue` does too). No action.
- **KUE-VIOLATES** — spec speaks, Kue is wrong (often because it matched a `cue` bug). FIX
  (spec-first fix-slice). Highest priority.
- **CUE-BUG / KUE-CORRECT** — spec speaks, `cue` is wrong, Kue follows the spec. Record in
  `cue-divergences.md`. No code action (already correct).
- **SPEC-SILENT / LATTICE-DERIVED** — spec silent, Kue's behavior is derivable as
  lattice-correct from first principles. Record the derivation; low risk.
- **SPEC-SILENT / SUSPECT-ARTIFACT** — spec silent, Kue's behavior only matches what the
  binary does and is NOT derivable (or contradicts) first principles. The danger zone:
  record in `cue-spec-gaps.md`, decide the principled behavior, FIX if it differs.

## Area decomposition (audited in risk order)

- **A. Disjunctions, defaults, narrowing** — default-mark algebra, resolution order, nested
  precedence, dedup, embedded-default narrowing, disjunction-arm pruning + structural
  discrimination (the argocd Gap-1/2/2b territory). HIGHEST risk — most `cue`-grounded.
- **B. Closedness & definitions** — open/closed, `...`, `#Def`, def-body closedness, the B6
  cluster, `importBinding`/hidden-field laziness, closed-meet.
- **C. Structs & lists** — meet, patterns, tail (the B2 `mergeStructN` matrix + B2.5
  cross-combinations), list meet, embeddings, scalar-embed collapse.
- **D. Comprehensions, references, scoping** — comprehension guards/sources/scoping, frame
  resolution, closures, cross-package def-meet.
- **E. Scalars, bounds, kinds, regex, arithmetic, builtins** — the "basic" lattice (likely
  CONFORMS, but verify cue-correctness, esp. bounds intersection + numeric/decimal).
- **F. Manifest/export & module/import semantics** — what errors vs. tolerates, hidden-field
  bottom propagation, field ordering (#3), incomplete-vs-error, cross-module resolution.

## Findings (ranked; filled as auditors return)

### Batch 1 (areas A, B, C) — complete 2026-06-19

**Fix-slices (KUE-VIOLATES — spec-first, ranked):**

1. **SC-1 (HIGH — closedness soundness; Kue wrong vs spec AND cue).** `mergeStructN` arms 5/6
   (`Lattice.lean:846-862`, pattern × plain) drop the *other* side's closedness/openness, so a
   closed `#Def` is silently re-opened when met with a pattern struct: `#C & P & {z:9}` admits
   `z`; spec ("closing = adding `..._|_`", conjunctive/monotone) and cue both reject. Fix:
   `StructOpenness.meet leftOpenness rightOpenness` + apply closedness from BOTH sides (each
   side's allowed set = own fields + own patterns). Contained; byte-identical gate + new
   spec-correct fixture.

2. **SC-2 (HIGH — closedness; requires DIVERGING from cue).** Closing-vs-instantiation. Spec:
   referencing a def recursively closes it "anywhere within the definition"; closedness
   persists through meet (monotone — meet cannot remove a constraint). cue RE-OPENS on
   instantiation (`(#D & {}).r & {b}` admits `b`) — an eval-strategy artifact, not
   lattice-derivable. Kue currently copies it. Fix = DIVERGE: preserve nested closedness on
   instantiation (reject `b`), record in `cue-divergences.md`. ⚠ This RE-SCOPES the B6-deferred
   sub-gap, which wrongly proposed *implementing* the artifact (a flag cleared on
   instantiation) — that direction is spec-wrong. ⚠ Real-app impact: verify cert-manager/argocd
   don't depend on the re-open before landing.

3. **SC-3 (LOW-MED — disjunction eval display/normalization).** `normalizeEvaluatedDisj`
   (`Eval.lean:648`) only flattens/dedups the all-regular case; a marked-default or nested
   `.disj` arm is emitted raw → `eval` display + structural `.disj` equality diverge (`*1|*1|2`
   shows raw, cue → `1`). Values stay correct (`export`/arithmetic force `resolveDisjDefault?`).
   Fix: apply `liveAlternatives` (flatten/drop-bottom/dedup) in the non-all-regular branch.

**Gap-2b / Bug2-3 — REAL bug, cue correct → PROCEED (was suspected artifact, now cleared).**
Structural arm pruning is spec-grounded ("unification distributes over disjunction" +
`list & {regular fields} = ⊥`). Kue under-prunes a list-shaped arm carrying a force-tier
spliced `_patch` against a struct host (`Eval.lean ~2661/2704`). ⚠ The fix MUST key on the
actual `.embeddedList`/list-meet-to-bottom, NOT a shape heuristic — cue does NOT prune two
*struct*-shaped arms (stays ambiguous `incomplete`), so over-eager shape discrimination would
itself be a divergence. Continue Bug2-3 as a correctness fix; record the basis as spec-grounded.

**Spec gaps (→ `cue-spec-gaps.md`):** import-binding laziness tolerating a bottom unreferenced
def (B#2 — flip basis from "match cue" to a deliberate operational gap; smell:
reference-location-dependent); the `incomplete value A | B` ambiguity form for un-narrowed
struct-arm disjunctions (A — lattice-defensible: a join with no unique default); struct-meet
output field ORDER (#3 — spec mandates none; Kue ≠ cue; re-derive a principled order, do NOT
inherit cue-pins).

**Vindicated CORRECT (cleared — were potential artifacts, proven lattice/spec-correct, keep):**
B2.5 pattern×tail unify; pattern dedup; scalar-embed `{5}`→`5`; list meet; hidden-field
deep-bottom propagation (deep IS spec-correct — recursive bottom rule); `StructOpenness`
lattice + meet; B6 direct-def-path close; default-mark cross-product algebra;
resolve-operand-first; embedded-default narrowing + the 4 argocd narrowing fixtures.

**Low / hardening:** `containsBottom` fuel cap 100 (`Lattice.lean:142` — a bottom >100 levels
deep escapes pruning → wrong value, not just slow; partiality hole); `{#a:1, 5}`
scalar-embed-with-definitions coverage gap.

**Spec-doc errors (cosmetic, no code action):** the CUE spec's disjunction worked-example
comments contradict its own U2 rule; cue + Kue both follow the rule.

_Pending batch 2 (D, E, F)._
