-- ### structural-cycle detection (D#2a).

-- whose body re-enters the SAME struct through a struct layer (`#L: {next: #L}`) — as an error,
-- DISTINCT from a bare REFERENCE cycle (`x: x` → `_`). Detection is an in-progress struct-body
-- stack on the `.refId` eval path (`structStack`): a struct body re-entered while still on the
-- stack bottoms with `.structuralCycle` rather than unrolling fuel-deep to garbage. These pins
-- cover the spec's oracle table (cue v0.16.1): error cases, the reference-cycle control, the
-- finite-deep control, and the recursive-list idiom that must NOT false-positive.

-- Oracle #1: a self-referential def is a structural cycle. The lever tags the re-entry
-- `.structuralCycle` (asserted on the REASON, not merely "some bottom"), so a regression to the
-- old fuel-deep unroll — or to an untagged bottom — fails. cue: `#L.next: structural cycle`.

-- ### terminating-disjunct (D#2b).
--
-- The spec's "a node is valid if any of its conjuncts is not cyclic" rule: a recursive def in a
-- disjunction (`#List | *null`) terminates by taking the non-cyclic arm once the cyclic arm bottoms
-- with `.structuralCycle` (D#2a). The cyclic arm is pruned by `liveAlternatives`/`resolveDisjDefault?`
-- (value resolution) — already the existing algebra; D#2b's code change is in `normalizeEvaluatedDisj`,
-- which now applies `liveAlternatives` (flatten + drop-bottom + dedup, SC-3) so the bottomed arm never
-- lingers in the EVAL value either. The pruning is value-SOUND: a `containsBottom` arm is dead in every
-- meet, so removing it changes no value. The surviving default is NOT collapsed into the value (a later
-- `a & 2` must still see a non-default arm) — default selection stays a manifest/force projection.
--
-- These pin the VALUE verdict (export, byte-identical to cue where the verdict agrees); Kue's eval
-- DISPLAY keeps the full `{…} | *null` per its established full-disjunction-with-default convention
-- (see `disjunctions/default_disjunction.expected`), which intentionally diverges from cue's
-- display-collapse — a recorded spec-gap, not a value bug. The export fixtures
-- `testdata/export/terminating_disj_*` carry the same verdicts as committed pairs.

-- Oracle #2 (the spec headline): `#List | *null` terminates on `*null` once the cyclic `#List` arm
-- bottoms → `tail: null`. cue agrees (`tail: null`); Kue under-resolved before D#2a+D#2b.
