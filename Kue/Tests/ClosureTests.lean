-- self-references a sibling (`out: #name`, `refId ⟨0,0⟩`). Selecting `parts.#M` OUTSIDE a
-- conjunction defers to a closure, then FORCES it standalone (no use-operands) — the terminal
-- value when there is no use-site to splice. With no narrowing, `out: #name` collapses against
-- the def's own `#name: string`, so the forced result is `{#name: string, out: string}`,
-- normalized-CLOSED (`open_ := false`). (A `pkg.#M & {narrow}` instead splices the narrowing via

-- ### A5-followup — comprehension-BODY self-ref deferral gate (`hasSelfRefAtDepthClauses`)
--
-- `hasSelfRefAtDepth`'s comprehension arms previously scanned the BODY at the comprehension's own
-- `depth`, ignoring the loop frame each `for` clause pushes. So a `Self.#t` read inside a `for`
-- body — resolved at `depth + #forClauses` — was compared against `depth`, MISSED, and the def
-- `#R = {#H, out: [for x in [1] {v: Self.#t}]}` was judged to have NO sibling self-ref. The `.conj`
-- `#R & {#t: "y"}` then took the eager-then-meet path (which cannot re-evaluate the comprehension
-- against the narrowed frame) instead of the closure-force path → stale `out: [{v: string|*"def"}]`.
-- Threading the loop-frame depth (`hasSelfRefAtDepthClauses`, +1 per `for`, +0 per `guard`) detects
-- the deep body ref and restores deferral. These pin the gate at the realistically-resolved depths.

-- A `.list [.listComprehension [for x …] {v: Self.#t}]` static-field value: the `Self` alias
-- read in the body resolves to `refId ⟨2, _⟩` (loop frame +1, body struct +1). Scanned from the
-- def frame (depth 0), the body sits at depth 2, so `⟨2,0⟩` IS the def self-ref — DETECTED only
-- once the loop frame is threaded. Pre-fix the body was scanned at depth 1 → `2 ≠ 1` → missed.

-- ### import-eager-closedness — the eager selector path closes a selected def body
--
-- A `pkg.#Def` selected via the EAGER path (`importDefClosureBody?` returns `none`, the common
-- self-ref-free case) plucks the def body and must CLOSE it, because an imported package's def
-- bodies are NOT closed at load (the `importBinding` arm of `normalizeFieldWithFuel` skips a bound
-- package to stay cue-lazy). Pre-fix the pluck returned the body OPEN, so a use-site `& {extra}`
-- silently admitted the undeclared field — an unsoundness (a closed def must reject it). The fix
-- routes every pluck through `selectedFieldValue`, the SINGLE closing decision the force path's
-- producers already use (`normalizeDefinitionValueWithFuel`), so the eager and force paths cannot
-- disagree about closedness.

-- UNIT — the single closing decision: `selectedFieldValue` closes a DEFINITION field's body
-- (`regularOpen` as stored → `defClosed` with a self-clause), so the eager pluck matches the
-- force path. Idempotent for an already-closed body; load-bearing for an imported one.
