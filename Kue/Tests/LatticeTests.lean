-- # `LatticeTests` — `meet` / `join` algebra (B4 + B2 regression gate)
--
-- Dedicated unit pins for the lattice operators. `meet` (greatest-lower-bound / unification)
-- and `join` (least-upper-bound / disjunction) are exercised indirectly all over `EvalTests`
-- and the fixtures, but had no home of their own (B4). This module pins the algebra directly,
-- with a deliberate focus on the **struct-shape arms B2 will collapse** — the
-- `struct`/`structTail`/`structPattern`/`structPatterns`/`structComp` pairwise meets.
--
-- Two layers, by what survives the B2 refactor:
--
-- * **Scalar / kind / bound / regex / list / disjunction algebra** — pinned at the
-- `meet`/`join` constructor level. These RHS values do not change under B2 (they touch no
-- struct constructor), so a constructor-level pin is the right, tightest gate.
-- * **Struct-shape behavior** — pinned at the SOURCE level via `evalSourceMatches`, NOT via
-- the internal `.structTail`/`.structPattern` constructor RHS. B2 collapses those five
-- constructors into one normalized struct, so any pin asserting a specific struct
-- constructor as its RHS would break *by construction* when B2 lands — a false regression.
-- A source→exported-value pin captures what `cue` produces and what B2 must preserve,
-- independent of which constructor carries it internally. (`StructTests` already pins the
-- `tail×struct` / `pattern×struct` arms at the constructor level; those are the merge-time
-- shapes that B2 keeps observable, so they are not duplicated here.)
--
-- All struct cases below are oracle-checked against `cue` v0.16.1 (`/Users/chakrit/go/bin/cue`).
--
-- ## B2.5 — the struct cross-combination fix (FIXED, pinned below)
--
-- `meetWithFuel` (`Lattice.lean`) once MISSED two struct cross-combinations: a pattern-bearing
-- struct meeting a tail-bearing struct (in either order) had no explicit arm and fell through to
-- `.bottom`, where `cue` unifies. The legacy five-constructor type could not co-represent a tail
-- AND patterns, so the arm was unrepresentable. The B2 collapse to one `ValuemkStruct (fields,
-- openness, tail, patterns)` carries both axes, and B2.5 flips the residual `.bottom` to a real
-- unify:
--
-- ```
-- #P: {[string]: int}
-- #T: {a: 5, ...}
-- out: #P & #T        // cue v0.16.1 → {a: 5} (open) ; kue → {a: 5} (open) — FIXED
-- ```
--
-- The pins below (`mergeStructN_*_unifies`, both orders, single + multi-pattern) lock in the
-- cue-correct unified value: the pattern constrains every field, the tail keeps the struct open,
-- and both axes are retained.

-- but does NOT widen `#C`'s closed allowed set: the meet is closed (`StructOpenness.meet`),
-- and `P`'s pattern is non-closing (an open conjunct closes nothing). Spec basis: closedness
-- is conjunctive/monotone ("closing = adding `..._|_`"); cue agrees (`#C & P & {z:9}` →
-- `out.z: field not allowed`). Before SC-1, arms 5/6 stored only the pattern side's openness
-- and dropped the plain side's closedness, re-opening `#C`.

-- `#C & P` (closed plain × open pattern): result is `defClosed`, carries `P`'s pattern as a
